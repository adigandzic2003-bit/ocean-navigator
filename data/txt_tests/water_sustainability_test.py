Bayer Global – Our Water Strategy (Water Stewardship)
Water Security strengthens Climate Resilience

The world’s ecological boundaries are currently being pushed past their limits. Water is not only essential for life on earth, but also for many industry sectors of the global economy and especially for us as a Life Science company. As the global population grows, we need to find sustainable, water-resilient solutions while facing additional pressure from climate-driven water challenges like increasing floods and droughts.

Our Water Strategy
Bayer’s mission of “Health for all, Hunger for none” is closely connected to the vital importance of water. As a leader in health and agriculture, we are dedicated to…

Our water strategy addresses potential water-related risks and leverages Bayer’s innovation skills to build business opportunities while adding value to communities. With 70% of global freshwater consumed by agriculture, Bayer is uniquely positioned to enhance water resilience through innovative scientific solutions that create a significant impact at scale.

Our Mid-Term Water Targets
Bayer’s engagement goes beyond our own operations and reflects our ambition to generate impact. These activities encompass the entire value chain, from our suppliers and own operations to the farmers, patients and consumers we serve.

Key elements of our water strategy include:

Resilient Agriculture, our chance to make a difference
Bayer commits to drive positive change in water productivity in water-scarce regional cropping systems, starting with rice, which is responsible for up to 43% of the world’s irrigation water withdrawals. The company has set a target to increase water productivity by 25% by 2030 against a 2019–2021 average baseline by transforming rice cropping in the relevant geographies where Bayer operates, starting in India.

Notes:
1) Water productivity is defined as kg of crop yield per volume of water used (kg/m³).
2) Baseline validation is still ongoing.
3) Bayer’s target currently focuses on the “DirectAcres Initiative,” which aims at supporting farmers shift successfully from transplanted puddled rice to mechanized direct seeded rice.

Sites and Facilities, the heart of our business
By 2030, Bayer’s Health divisions aim to reduce their water withdrawals by 20% compared to the 2024 baseline. (The source text notes local water scarcity and Bayer’s share of the region’s total withdrawal as weighting factors; and references evaluation data from Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas.)

Context and examples of actions (as depicted in the infographic section):
Global challenge:
• Some 700 million people could be displaced by intense water scarcity by 2030 (UNICEF).
• Water scarcity: demand for water exceeding available supply.
• Amplified by climate change and economic growth.
• Risk to Food Security, Health and Economic & Political Stability.

Our approach:
Be a thought leader on global water resilience; addressing the global water crisis through a comprehensive Water Strategy; collaborations on various levels from the UN to rural communities.

Our actions:
Investments with maximum impact; replacing once-through by closed-loop cooling systems; reuse of treated wastewater; reducing water for off-gas treatment.
Our impacts:
Lower withdrawals from surface & groundwater; lower heat load to rivers; lower long-term operating costs; higher production resilience.

Additional statements on operations and wastewater:
Bayer will build upon the already existing mitigation activities and water management systems to further assess water-related risks at relevant sites in water-scarce areas and extend them to sites forecast to be in water-scarce regions by 2030.
Bayer continues to reduce emissions at its sites worldwide, including emissions into wastewater. Beyond that, strict voluntary discharge limits for active ingredients into wastewater have been established at all sites where they are produced.

Suppliers and Growers
Bayer evaluates the sustainability performance of key suppliers and selected high-sustainability-risk suppliers and includes water as an evaluation criterion.

Ambassador and Partnerships
Addressing the water crisis requires joint action from a myriad of stakeholders. Bayer is well connected in the water space via its involvement in the World Meteorological Organization for Water and Climate Leaders, active participation in the Water Resilience Coalition, and the International Drought Resilience Alliance (IDRA). Bayer intends to use these partnerships to connect the right leaders and ensure appropriate private sector engagement.

Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services
Bayer is committed to providing safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) to all employees at its sites.
In cooperation with local NGOs, Bayer engages in community projects in water-scarce regions and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Example (India): cooperation with the Safe Water Network to improve the health of more than 270,000 people in rural/peri-urban communities by providing reliable water access through 90 “Jal Safe Water Stations”.

Additional infographic metrics (as shown):
• 2.1 billion people still lack safely managed drinking water services in 2024 (UNICEF).
• Over 30 minutes to collect drinking water or reliable source.
• Higher risk of waterborne diseases, economic & social inequality.
Selected actions listed include: reliable & safe drinking water for 270,000+ people in peri-urban India by 2026; revived & recharged 700+ dormant borewells benefitting 1,200 smallholder farmers in India; installed 36 rainwater harvesting systems enhancing hygiene & awareness for 18,000+ students in Mexico; and “over 100,000 people reached with numerous additional projects”.

Bayer’s Water Position

Update Water Position 2025
August 2025

RESTRICTED

Our purpose “Health for all, hunger for none” guides our actions to help achieve a high quality of life on a
healthy planet. Accordingly, the protection of all natural resources is an integral part of Bayer’s commitment
towards sustainable development. Our activities align with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs), including SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). Our water position specifically addresses
SDGs 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.8.
The availability of fresh water is a growing global concern. Water is not only essential for life on earth but
also for many industry sectors of the global economy and particularly for us as a Life Science company.
For Bayer, the primary use of fresh water includes chemical production processes and the irrigation of fields
and greenhouses for seed production. Fresh water is also required by our suppliers as well as by our
customers. Some of our sites are located in water scarce regions, where an increased risk of substantive
impact on our business is possible. Therefore, we are committed to ensure good water management at all
relevant sites, particularly in these regions.
Aiming to protect water resources and to improve water-use efficiency both within the company and beyond,
we are engaged in four main areas:

1

Developing Innovative Solutions

We believe that the greatest positive changes come from product innovations and solutions that create
substantial improvements in our value chain.
•

The agricultural sector, which consumes nearly 70% of global freshwater withdrawals, plays a
crucial role in addressing challenges related to water shortages. In line with our vision, “Health for
all, Hunger for none,” Bayer aims to contribute to a more water-efficient agriculture with the
ambition to generate impact beyond its own operations. Examples of areas of focus include:
o

As a global leader in agricultural innovation, our innovative potential is used to develop
scientific solutions that help build more water resilience in agriculture (e.g. Arize® hybrid
rice).

o

We leverage our partnerships to encourage engagement and action on water and join efforts
to build, test, and promote solutions and agronomic practices that have the potential to drive
a more water efficient agriculture (e.g. TELA Maize project).

o

We have set ourselves an ambitious target to support our smallholder customers to
increase water productivity by 25% by 2030- against a 2019–2021 average baseline - by
transforming rice cropping in the relevant geographies where Bayer operates.1

•

We partner with farmers and other stakeholders to demonstrate how innovative and modern
agricultural tools can help conserve water resources and benefit farmers, the environment
and society (e.g. Bayer ForwardFarms).

•

Bayer allocates a substantial portion of its R&D budget to the development of innovative health
therapies, including stem cell and gene therapies, proteins, and biologics. While the primary goal
is to enhance patient health, these biological therapies also reduce pharmaceutical residues in
the patients' excrement and thus the micropollutants in sewage water, especially when compared
to chemistry-based therapies.

•

We collaborate with the German Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft and industry partners to reduce Iodine
from patients’ urine in hospital wastewater. To further lower Iodine and Gadolinium levels in
wastewater, we also collect leftover contrast media from hospitals to recover these substances
through our re:contrast program.

1 Water

productivity is defined as kilogram of crop yield per volume of water used (kg/m3). The baseline validation is
still ongoing. Our water target is currently focusing on the DirectAcres Initiative, which aims at supporting farmers shift
successfully from transplanted puddled rice to mechanized direct seeded rice.

2

Improving Our Own Operations

Bayer is dedicated to preventing water pollution and complying with all international and local
laws. We set stringent voluntary discharge limits for all active ingredients. Additionally, Bayer is
constantly striving to optimize the water use in its sites, taking local contexts into account. To achieve
this, we
•

Globally monitor site water withdrawals, usage, discharges, and consumption.

•

Continuously enhance water reuse and recycling.

•

Identify optimization potentials and consider reduction actions at our sites, considering compliance
as well as financial, sustainable, and technical feasibility.

•

Assess and mitigate water-related risks at our sites, especially in areas threatened by water
scarcity by 2030.

•

Apply European environmental standards as a minimum requirement for new investments
worldwide, also if local regulations are less stringent.

Our Health Care divisions aim to reduce their water withdrawal, weighted by the water stress and the
own share of the respective regions’ total withdrawal, by 20%, related to a 2024 baseline, by 2030.

3

Engaging Our Suppliers

The availability of fresh water also impacts our suppliers and vice versa. Therefore, we

4

•

Drive continuous improvements in water efficiency among our suppliers, with a special focus
on irrigation practices by our seed growers.

•

Outline our expectations in the Bayer Supplier Code of Conduct Guidance and share best
practices regarding water management in the supply chain.

•

Engage relevant suppliers in annual sustainability performance evaluations, which will include
assessments of their water usage and management.

Supporting Water-related Community Projects

We leverage our local presence and collaborate with various organizations to support projects that
provide access to clean water and sanitation for our employees and the communities in which we
operate. We also focus on raising awareness and building skills around water management. Therefore,
we engage in meaningful global water initiatives (e.g., WMO water and climate leaders) and collaborate
on local projects on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), such as our partnership with Safe Water
Network in India, transforming the lives of 270,000 people.

To strengthen our four areas of commitment, Bayer’s organizational processes are designed to ensure a
common approach for all direct and indirect engagement activities. Sustainability is a core element of our
Group Strategy - across divisions and geographies- and it is in the direct responsibility of Bayer’s Chief
Executive Officer. Within our organization we have a water community reflecting on our own operations and
the value chains of our different divisions. We assess the environmental impacts of new investment projects,
considering specific conditions of the location and the facility in line with our guideline “Ecological and
Sustainability Assessment of new Investments”. As a result, we have improved risk mitigation at site level,
with the goal that new investments will further support our overall sustainability strategy.
Furthermore, our Bayer Supplier Code of Conduct applies to all suppliers, emphasizing responsible usage,
protection, and management of water. We expect our direct suppliers to replicate these standards
throughout their supply chains.
A responsible and sustainable use of water requires the commitment of various stakeholders, including
regulators, NGOs, academia, the public, and the private sector. We believe that this global challenge and
our objectives can best be met through multi-lateral partnerships, and we actively engage in water-related
initiatives with international and local partners. To facilitate the transfer of knowledge and best practices,
we are committed to the transparent reporting of our water-related activities.

Editorial

Driving Our Mission Forward: For the People, For the Planet
Dear Bayer stakeholders,
Health for all, Hunger for none – our mission is at the heart of
everything we do at Bayer. We're dedicated to better health,
improved patient care, and innovative agriculture to not only
produce more food but also restore nature: by improving soil
health, restoring biodiversity, and conserving water.
This past year has been a stark reminder of why our work
matters. Record-breaking heat, devastating floods, and rising food insecurity have affected millions. Meanwhile, billions
of people still struggle to access essential medicines and
healthcare, and effective treatments for many critical diseases simply don’t exist. And while these challenges may
seem overwhelming, I firmly believe in the power of science
and collaboration to create meaningful change. That’s why
we’re pushing the boundaries of science to find solutions
that truly make a difference – for you, for your family, and for
our planet.
Let's highlight some of our key achievements from the
past year:
// AI Innovations: In 2024, Bayer broke new ground with
AI, in both farming and healthcare. Our partnership with
Microsoft led to a generative AI tool, boosting agricultural
productivity and sustainability. This tool upskills agronomists and empowers farmers with smarter, data-driven
decisions. And in healthcare, our AI Innovation Platform,
developed with Google Cloud and other partners, is
streamlining the development of AI/machine learning
healthcare applications, from imaging-based diagnostics
to treatment options.

// Nutrition Access: Our Nutrient Gap Initiative reached 26
million people in underserved communities, providing vital
nutrients for healthier lives, from food to supplementation.
// Medical Breakthroughs: Our pioneering work in cell and
gene therapies is forging new frontiers in disease treatment. In January 2025, we announced that our investigational cell therapy in Parkinson’s disease is advancing to
Phase III – a first of its kind. Additionally, in June 2024,
we presented our plans to build a translational center for
cell and gene therapies in Berlin, in collaboration with
Charité Berlin and other partners.
// Climate-Resilient Farming: The devastating drought in
sub-Saharan Africa in 2024 highlighted the need for resilient food systems. By developing drought-tolerant maize
varieties, we aim to enhance food security and support
smallholder farmers in building a sustainable agricultural
future. We successfully brought ‘Direct Seeded Rice’ to
around 18,700 hectares in India, with the goal of reaching
1 million hectares by 2030. Direct Seeded Rice is a less
resource-intensive rice cultivation system, offering several
environmental benefits, such as reduced water use and
lower greenhouse gas emissions.
// Reducing our Footprint: In June 2024, we introduced our
Climate Transition Plan, outlining our journey to Net Zero.
Our ambition is clear: to achieve climate neutrality at our
sites by 2030 and to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions
by at least 90% across our value chain by 2050. In the
future, our collaboration with Cat Creek Energy will ensure
40% of Bayer's global electricity and 60% of our U.S.
electricity comes from renewable sources. In Germany, our
agreement with the Wuppertal public utility company and
investments in geothermal energy and zero-emission steam
generation underscore our commitment to sustainability.

These initiatives are just a glimpse of Bayer's efforts towards a sustainable future. They significantly contribute to
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and align with
the UN Global Compact principles.
The journey ahead is filled with both opportunities and challenges. This report outlines our ambitions and progress.
Moreover, insights from the recent “Breakthrough Study,”
one of the largest surveys on attitudes towards emerging
technologies, reveal a crucial truth: The more people know
about a technology, the more positively they view it. That’s
why we must not only innovate boldly but also communicate
clearly. Advancing science for the planet and its people requires building trust and ensuring transparency.
The challenges ahead are daunting, but they are not insurmountable. By working together – scientists, farmers,
healthcare professionals, and communities – we can create
a healthier, more resilient future. I invite you to join us in this
mission. Your insights and your voices are vital in shaping
the sustainable future we all strive for.

Sincerely,

Bill Anderson
Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) &
Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) of Bayer AG

About this Report

About this Report
With this Impact Report, Bayer aims to provide transparent
and in-depth insights into both its sustainability strategy and
its sustainability performance. This report supplements the
Sustainability Statement which serves as nonfinancial statement for the Bayer Group (Section 315b et seq. of the German Commercial Code, HGB). The reporting standards applied for the Sustainability Statement pursuant to Section
289d of the German Commercial Code (HGB) are the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The Sustainability Statement is published in the Combined Management
Report of the 2024 Annual Report. Throughout this Impact
Report, we refer to data points in the Sustainability Statement, which has been subject to an external audit with limited
assurance for the fiscal year 2024.
The reporting period for this Impact Report is the 2024 fiscal
year. The closing date for all data and facts was December
31, 2024.
The Bayer Group’s sustainability reporting has been aligned
to the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and
the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) since
2000. Together with the Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024, this Impact Report also serves as a reference for the questionnaire on the Communication on Progress in line with the UN Global Compact. We also take into
account the relevant requirements of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). A summarized index according to the three SASB Industry Standards relevant to us
– “Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals,” “Chemicals” and “Agricultural Products” – can be found on our website. In our
climate reporting, we follow the recommendations of the
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
and publish a separate report in PDF format also on our
website. We also publish an overview of the Principal

Adverse Indicators according to the Sustainable Finance
Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) on our website.
We also use, for example, the international recommendations
and guidelines of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) and ISO 26000 as a guide when
defining and selecting nonfinancial indicators and in our
reporting. In measuring the key data we are publishing, we
apply the European Sustainability Reporting Standards
(ESRS) and also take into account the recommendations of
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol with respect to greenhouse
gas emissions and those of the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development, the European Chemical Industry
Council (CEFIC) and the International Council of Chemical
Associations (ICCA) with respect to other nonfinancial indicators.

Sustainability Drives Value and Growth
A growing world population and the increasing burden on
natural ecosystems are among the biggest challenges humanity is facing. This situation is further complicated by various geopolitical conflicts that are escalating. Furthermore,
these crises clearly show how important it is to protect
health and ensure food security worldwide – and how these
goals are in jeopardy.
Our overall goal: from margin to impact
As a global leader in healthcare and nutrition, Bayer can contribute more than any other enterprise to solving global challenges through its business. With this goal in mind, Bayer is
committed to ambitious targets that it aims to achieve through
its own business activity and the endeavors of its employees.
To support Bayer’s mission of “Health for all, Hunger for none,”
we defined three areas where we have a significant impact and
aim to both boost our ambitions and drive our business solutions forward:
// Climate action
// Health equity
// Food security
Bayer is uniquely positioned to provide solutions to these
challenges – alongside our partners.

Our Areas of Impact

Climate Action
Our impact on the 55Gt
of CO 2 in our value chain

Health Equity

Food Security

Our impact
on 4 billion people
with no access to
basic healthcare

Our impact
on inflation & 1 billion
chronically hungry
people

We look at these areas of action from a holistic perspective,
knowing there are strong interdependencies and that it is at
the intersections where Bayer can make a scalable difference in ways that drive our business:
// Climate change negatively impacts both the availability
and nutritional value of staple food crops and vegetables.
This creates a challenging cycle of growing more nutritious
food without undermining our planet.
// Health needs and access are challenged by climate
change, with rising temperatures compounding health
issues and new or more diseases. This creates a heavy
burden for both people and health systems – and especially for people living in the low- and middle-income
countries.

// Food security fundamentally depends on the continuous
development and advancement of sustainable agricultural
innovations and on the health of farmers and communities
who produce food – and, in turn, health is dependent on
the availability of nutritious diets.
By addressing these areas with a clear focus on interdependence and our impact, we will contribute to closing the nutrient gap, strengthening regenerative agriculture and delivering
solutions for people’s health, in the face of rapidly increasing
temperatures worldwide.
Sustainability is part of our corporate strategy
Building on our mission of “Health for all, Hunger for none,”
we consider sustainability to be at the core of our corporate
responsibility – and it also safeguards our future growth.
Sustainability is therefore an essential component of our
corporate strategy, our business activities, our corporate
values and the way in which we conduct our business. The
following strategic sustainability targets apply as a guideline
for the actions of all divisions:
// Creating inclusive growth and added value for society
and our investors
// Reducing our ecological footprint
// Embracing responsible business practices along our
value chain

Sustainability Strategy

1. The Company

2. Corporate Governance

Our contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals
We align our own strategic sustainability targets with the
global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United
Nations, which apply through to 2030. The global community is lagging behind in many areas, which makes the contribution we can make as a company to achieving these
goals all the more important.
At Bayer, we are convinced that we can have a particular
impact here, owing to our portfolio, our global reach and our
innovative power. In this context, we consciously support
those Sustainable Development Goals where there is a
pressing need to act and where we can make the greatest
impact through our businesses and their sustainability-focused transformation.
SDG 1 – No poverty
As farming is often the only source of income in
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), we
help to fight poverty there through our engagement with
smallholder farmers and by supporting women.
SDG 2 – Zero hunger
Our products and services help the global agricultural industry to increase production, and thus reduce food inflation, to feed a growing world population,
while consuming fewer natural resources. This also benefits
smallholder farmers in LMICs.
SDG 3 – Good health and well-being
Our products directly impact people’s health.
Some prevent diseases and others treat illnesses.
This applies worldwide – but particularly in LMICs, where we
endeavor to make existing products and services accessible
and affordable.

3. Product Stewardship

4. Procurement

5. Human Rights

6. Employees

SDG 5 – Gender equality
We work to achieve gender equality in our business and through our supply chain. By providing
modern contraception, we support women around the
world in self-determined family planning. We also promote
equal opportunity within our company.
SDG 6 – Clean water and sanitation
Our products and services help reduce future
water consumption in agriculture. We strive to protect water resources, use them as sparingly as possible
and further reduce water pollution.
SDG 13 – Climate action
We pursue a climate protection and decarbonization strategy that is aligned with the goals of the
Paris Agreement. In our value chain, we promote resilient,
low-emission farming that helps to capture carbon dioxide
(CO2) through new methods.

The Group-wide goals for inclusive growth and climate protection are accounted for in the long-term variable compensation (LTI) of our Board of Management and our LTI-entitled
managerial employees. Our strategic focuses also address
the demands increasingly expressed by the capital market
that we transform our business from a sustainability perspective and report transparently on this using key data.
In doing so, we want to be trustworthy and binding in our
actions in relation to our stakeholders.
Focus areas: added value for people and the
environment
Bayer initiated an ambitious program that combines inclusive growth with the reduction of ecological footprint and
aims to establish responsible business practices throughout
our entire value chain. Bayer is thus living up to its responsibility toward the environment and society and has integrated
this into its corporate governance.

SDG 15 – Life on land
By reducing the environmental impact of crop protection products (Crop Protection Environmental
Impact Reduction [CP EIR]), we support sustainable farming
that aims to protect the environment within our value chain and
to conserve biodiversity.
Our strategic approach
Bayer aims to promote sustainable development worldwide
in accordance with the SDGs, while at the same time focusing on the future and aligning its businesses to grow in line
with the sustainability targets. To achieve this, we link the
concept of inclusive growth with a reduction in our ecological footprint based on responsible business practices along
our entire value chain.

Access to healthcare

Millions of people still do not have access to basic medical
care. Our portfolio includes a range of key products that are
among the world’s leading pharmaceuticals for their indications by sales, for example in the areas of cardiology,
women’s healthcare, ophthalmology and radiology. We believe we have a responsibility to improve access to
healthcare for a growing world population. We reach people
all over the world with the products and solutions of our
Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health divisions. As part of
this, we also assess the needs of people in LMICs, for
whom we want to make existing products and services accessible and affordable. At the same time, we are driving
forward innovations to increase access to healthcare worldwide and thus improve people’s health and well-being. In
this way, we are making a significant contribution to the attainment of SDG 3 “Good health and well-being.”
Food security: nutrition and agriculture

Hunger has increased worldwide in recent years, as the impact of climate change and the effects of armed conflicts are
contributing to food shortages. In the area of agriculture and
nutrition, our innovative products and services help to better
feed the growing world population and fight hunger. In this
way, we are contributing to SDG 2 “Zero hunger” by targeting
inclusive growth in LMICs. The 550 million or so smallholder
farmers worldwide play a central role in improving the food
supply in these countries. As farming is often the only
source of income for many people there, our engagement
with smallholder farmers helps achieve SDG 1 “No poverty.”

Responsible business practices

Climate change mitigation

In view of advancing climate change and its devastating
consequences for human nutrition and health, one area of
focus for reducing the ecological footprint is an ambitious
decarbonization strategy. Our targets are in line with the
Paris Agreement. To this end, we pursue extensive
measures to support SDG 13 “Climate action.” For example,
we are reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions (Scope
1 & 2) and greenhouse gas emissions along our value chain
(Scope 3). Our reduction targets were confirmed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which has been updated and revalidated during the reporting year 2024. We
want to achieve Net Zero emissions in our entire value chain
by 2050, this represents a reduction of minus 90 % compared to the baseline of the year 2019. Furthermore, we aim
to enable our farming customers to reduce their on-field
greenhouse gas emissions.
Climate change adaptation

We are also helping to increase the resilience of our customers against the effects of climate change. Among the approaches we are developing in this connection are transformative solutions that aim to enable agriculture to emit
fewer greenhouse gases and instead contribute to efforts to
capture CO2. This makes agriculture an important enabler in
the fight against climate change.

Responsible business practices along the value chain define
our company values and shape the way we conduct our
business – from our commitment to environmental protection to our endeavors in relation to gender equality and respecting human rights.
Gender equality

We promote inclusion and diversity throughout Bayer, and
this includes gender equality – SDG 5. We achieve the
greatest impact through our business, particularly through
our products to promote women’s health and family planning
and through our targeted support for female smallholder
farmers as entrepreneurs in LMICs. We also promote equality in our own company and aim to achieve gender balance
at all management levels by 2030.
Respect for human rights

We fully respect human rights and updated our human rights
strategy in 2023 to address risks and effects in that area.
The strategy supports the attainment of our corporate mission
and the implementation of the SDGs. Bayer is a founding
member of the UN Global Compact and respects the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations.

Reducing the ecological footprint

We want to reduce our ecological footprint along our entire
value chain. With our solutions for more sustainable farming,
we aim to protect the environment and biodiversity in accordance with SDG 2 “Zero hunger” and SDG 15 “Life on land.”
We aim to reduce the environmental impact of our crop protection products in farming and support the use of innovative

Water stewardship

As a leader in health and agriculture, our ambition is to contribute to sustainable water use through a holistic water strategy. We aim to have a transformational impact that goes beyond our own operations and reflects our willingness to
contribute to climate resilience and protect water resources.

Access to Healthcare as an Element of Sustainability
People in many parts of the world still do not have access to
basic medical care, even though the need is high. Furthermore, regional and global crises continue to drive inequality
in global society.

This particularly applies to our globally leading products in
women’s healthcare, including with respect to family planning, and in areas such as cardiovascular disease, eye diseases, cancer and neglected tropical diseases ( SDG 3).

As part of our mission of “Health for all, Hunger for none”
and the corresponding business strategy, we are addressing
important medical needs and expanding access to our products and services, in both the prescription and the over-thecounter sector. We are thus helping to improve access to
healthcare for a growing world population ( SDG 3).

Modern contraception – a key factor
In many parts of the world, self-determination for girls and
women depends largely on whether and when they start a
family. Young women’s desire to participate in education can
only be fulfilled if the advantages and opportunities of family
planning are recognized and suitable healthcare services
and contraceptives are available.

Many of our programs specifically focus on the health of
women and children, thus also supporting gender equality
( SDG 5).

Access to prescription medicines
With our prescription medicines, we make a valuable contribution to individual health and well-being, as well as sustainable development in general.
In 2024, Bayer established the Global Health Unit (GHU)
with the mission of fostering inclusive growth by expanding
reach and creating impact at scale for underserved populations. The GHU focuses primarily, but not exclusively, on
more than 50 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
where Bayer has a limited presence. By developing partnerships with supranational, regional, and governmental organizations, Bayer aims to improve access to medicine and advance in health and gender equality.

It is therefore not just a question of self-determined health,
but also a human right to give women and girls the opportunity to choose the number, timing and intervals of their
pregnancies.
As a component of family planning, modern contraception
plays a key role in improving the health, rights and economic
situation of women around the world. It thus provides the
foundation for more equality and affluence and plays a crucial role in enabling participation in better education and improving health ( SDG 3) and reducing poverty ( SDG 1)
and hunger ( SDG 2). Family planning also strengthens
gender equality ( SDG 5), which in turn promotes economic and social development. According to the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID),
investment in family planning is therefore a “best buy” for
development.

Access to modern contraception
As a leading global pharmaceutical producer of contraceptives, we have been active in this field for many years. We
aim to fulfill the need of 100 million women in LMICs for
modern contraception by 2030. In 2024, we already reached
51 million women in LMICs.
Target 2030:

To attain our target, we focus on the availability, accessibility
and affordability of our products with resilient supply chains
and uniform quality standards globally. Moreover, in partnership programs we are sharing resources and capabilities
with other stakeholders to support women and girls, helping
them to make contraceptive choices that suit them best, regardless of the product or its manufacturer.

Product accessibility

In 2024, Bayer’s contraceptive products were used by
women in 121 countries of the world. These contraceptives
are provided to 92 countries through procurement platforms
(e.g. via the United Nations Population Fund [UNFPA]) or
through international tenders opened by the Ministry of
Health of recipient countries. Bayer applies a set of preferable pricing schemes to allow as many women as possible to
have access to family planning products. Paid by donor or
domestic funds, these contraceptives are mostly free for the
final recipient. In 2024, 26 million women used Bayer products through this mechanism.
In addition, Bayer country affiliates in LMICs are providing
family planning products to the local pharmaceutical market
through the pharmacy channel. In these cases, where
women must pay for contraceptives themselves, we aim to
apply a fair pricing approach to enable more women to access these products. In an increasing number of countries,
Bayer sells to the public market under national health programs that include free access to contraceptives. Bayer’s
presence in local markets in LMICs is strong, with 82 countries following this model and providing contraceptive products to 20 million women in 2024.
Notably, in 51 countries, Bayer is active in both the private
and the public sector, ensuring broad access to family planning to women across all income levels.

Partnerships

Beyond its role as a manufacturer for contraceptives, Bayer
is entering into partnerships with a variety of stakeholders to
pursue a common agenda for access to rights-based family
planning and gender equality. Guiding principles for such
partnerships and resulting programs are:
// Demand driven with a strong local governance
// Contributing to the 100 million women goal
// Capacity building, strengthening the local
healthcare system
// Sustainable approach with a long-term impact

and Africa (P3 Impact Award given by the US Department of
State, the University of Virginia and Concordia at the Concordia Annual Summit).
Differentiated pricing strategy
Our established approach to pricing and access to our
prescription medicines not only ensures that our products
are sold in reimbursement markets but is also geared specifically toward enabling these products to be offered in LMICs
while taking the local purchasing power into account. In this,
we work together with patients, charitable organizations, governmental authorities and other players to enable easier,
sustainable access to our products based on adjusted pricing.
For most of our key products (AdempasTM, EyleaTM,
KerendiaTM, KyleenaTM, MirenaTM, NexavarTM, Stivarga TM,
VerquvoTM and XareltoTM), including specific new launches,
we have established the framework conditions for adjusted,

Access to self-care
More than half the world’s population has no access to
basic and essential health services due to insufficient income, health deserts and a lack of access to clinics, pharmacies or other treatment options. Consequently, billions of
people must rely on self-care to prevent disease, maintain
their health or treat illness.
We want to support 100 million people in economically or
medically underserved communities with self-care by interventions from Bayer by 2030. As a leader in science-based
self-care solutions, we are already present and investing in
many countries and regions where self-care is a health lifeline. In 2024, we continued to make progress and expand
partnerships to drive access to self-care.

Nutrient Gap Initiative
One in three people in the world are surviving on diets
that are lacking in the essential vitamins and minerals
that are needed to enable them to grow properly, live
healthy lives and raise a healthy family. The effects of
this “hidden hunger” often worsen over time, can lead
to long-term health problems and further accelerate
the poverty cycle.
As a global leader in both agriculture and nutritional
supplements, Bayer is uniquely positioned to help enable all people to have access to essential vitamins
and minerals and improve their livelihoods. Launched
in 2021, the Nutrient Gap Initiative (NGI) is Bayer’s signature program to enable access to essential vitamins
and minerals for 50 million people annually by 2030.
The initiative addresses the main barriers to accessing
micronutrients through interventions with accessible
and affordable nutrition solutions, education and advocacy. Initially focusing on essential supplementation,
the initiative was expanded to include our food portfolio, which includes vegetables, fruits and grains.
To achieve these aims, we are forming strategic partnerships, for example with Vitamin Angels to reach
four million women and their babies with essential prenatals each year and with the last-mile health social
enterprise reach52 to provide nutrition education to
underserved communities. Moreover, we are leveraging the Better Life Farming Centers (please see the

Vitamin Angels

Since 2020, we have been partnering with Vitamin Angels to
reach underserved pregnant women, infants and children
with multiple micronutrient supplements (MMS) and health
education. In 2024, our partnership reached more than 7
million underserved pregnant women and their babies
across 17 priority countries, including Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and the United States,
bringing the total to 20 million women and babies since the
start of our collaboration. In 2024, we continued to help
support Vitamin Angels and academic partners to develop a
continuing medical education curriculum to train healthcare
providers on the importance of micronutrients. This curriculum was launched in Indonesia, Mexico and the United
States.
Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have also become
important implementation partners for Vitamin Angels, helping to expand the reach of its activity into Central American
communities. Through our partnership with Un Kilo de

health workers between 2021 and 2024 and engaged with
more than 460,000 residents. In addition, we have reached
more than 870 communities to date via posters and community educational programs across the five countries.

In 2024, we intentionally focused on smallholder farmers
whom we are already supporting through our comprehensive agricultural and livelihood solutions (please see section
on smallholder farmers), as smallholder farmers’ ability to
feed their communities depends on their health. We are leveraging our portfolio and partnerships, including with

local NGOs since 2019 to provide health screening to
women. The focus is on vaginal health and on training midwives, who act as healthcare contacts in remote communities. Since 2023, the focus has also included cardiovascular
health.
Policy engagement
In 2024, Bayer continued to engage with the Global SelfCare Federation (GSCF), supporting efforts to raise the
global agenda of self-care, promoting policies to support
everyday health and contributing to multi-stakeholder action,
which is a top priority and a key strategic endeavor for
GSCF. A multi-faceted approach through the Self Care Coalition encompassed engagement with governments, the
World Health Organization (WHO) and other influential multilateral organizations, academia, NGOs, patient representatives and healthcare professionals, fostering a dynamic new
coalition of allies.
One of the strategic priorities of GSCF and the Coalition for
Self-Care is to drive support for a WHO resolution on selfcare. Through global health forums such as the World Health
Assembly, the United Nations General Assembly and the
World Health Summit, GSCF engaged policymakers in discussions on the role of self-care in strengthening health system
sustainability. As a result of these engagements, several countries encouraged the WHO to consider a resolution on selfcare. In response, the WHO has included self-care on the
agenda for its Executive Board meeting in Q1 2025, to explore how self-care could be formally included in the Universal
Health Coverage programmatic area. This marked a significant milestone for the self-care community, as increased
recognition at the global level could help embed self-care
more firmly within health policies, ultimately contributing to
more resilient and sustainable healthcare systems.

Sustainability at the core of our brands
Sustainability is firmly anchored in our brand and product
strategies. We integrate our sustainability commitments into
the earliest stages of product development through our Sustainability by Design program to design innovation with availability, the environment and health in mind.
Bayer is an active partner in the GSCF’s working group focused on implementing more sustainable blister packaging.
We also joined the Blister Pack Collective to replace plastic
packaging with a new dry-molded fiber blister pack made
from renewable plant fibers. Replacing plastic packaging will
reduce our carbon footprint in the future and support our
goal to transition all Consumer Health products to 100% recycle-ready packaging (where safety permits and regulations
allow). Initially, we are exploring how dry-molded fiber blister
packs can be added to blister packaging and rolled out to
other products as we develop and launch more sustainable
solutions. In 2024, Bayer launched the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) blister packaging for Aleve. In partnership with
pharma packaging specialist Liveo Research, this reduces
the carbon footprint of this packaging by 38% and supports
efforts in our environmental stewardship by eliminating the
use of polyvinyl chloride.

Transformation toward Sustainable Agriculture
Global agriculture and food systems are facing major challenges, such as climate change, water scarcity, degraded
land and biodiversity loss. At the same time, the world population continues to grow, and millions of people are suffering from hunger and poverty. The growing global demand for
food, feed, fiber and fuels will have to be met across a decreasing production area.
We work toward achieving sustainable agriculture that addresses the biggest challenges by means of innovation – agriculture that meets the needs of a growing world population
while conserving natural resources ( SDG 2); agriculture that
emits fewer greenhouse gases and instead contributes to
capturing carbon dioxide (CO 2); and agriculture that protects
biodiversity and helps farmers worldwide to deal with the effects of climate change and become more resilient. The focus
here is on increasing yields through innovative seeds, products and services, as well as on disseminating agricultural
practices and forms of cultivation with ever-reduced environmental impact.

their products at appropriate prices. At the same time,
smallholder farmers are also highly exposed to the impacts
of climate change and increasingly to harvest losses. For all
these reasons, they are often not able to achieve a stable income through farming.
Typical Challenges Smallholder Farmers Are Facing

Lack of access to
new technologies

Limited access to
knowledge

Many of these smallholder farmers are facing significant
challenges. Their yields are often low because they do not
have access to high-quality crops and practical knowledge
about more productive and environmentally friendly cultivation methods. Often, they do not have affordable financing
opportunities and access to markets on which they can sell

Target 2030:

Support 100 million smallholder
farmers in LMICs

Limited

Smallholder farmers
The 550 million or so smallholder farmers worldwide play a
central role in improving the quality of life in low- and middleincome countries (LMICs) and thus implementing our mission
“Health for all, Hunger for none.” They form the backbone of
food security in many rural regions of the world.

We aim to support a total of 100 million smallholder farmers
in LMICs by 2030 by improving their access to agricultural

partners. To achieve this, we are increasing our range of
commercial efforts and strategic initiatives tailored to the
needs of smallholder farmers. Our strategy for strengthening
smallholder farmers is embedded in our regional commercial

Sustainability Strategy

2. Corporate Governance

We are successively expanding our product and service
portfolio for smallholder farmers, including innovative business models and digital solutions across the entire crop system. This includes solutions from the areas of digital farming
and market access, a differentiated product portfolio, biotechnological solutions and the formation of partnerships
along the value chain.
We aim to create market models that generate benefit and
reduce business risks for all partners in the value chain, including smallholder farmers. This is implemented by helping
smallholder farmers gain access to the agricultural value
chain and increase their productivity and income, as well as
by creating resilience to ensure the long-term food security
of smallholder farmers, their families and rural regions in
LMICs.
Bayer does not plan to assert its intellectual property rights
against smallholder farmers who save seeds on their farms
for private and noncommercial use in order to avoid extreme
poverty. Instead, we want to work together with these smallholder farmers to introduce them to the world of commercial
farming and enable them to improve their livelihoods.
Value chain partnerships
As no one can overcome every challenge alone, we establish
crop value chain partnerships to provide smallholder farmers
with high-quality inputs, agronomic knowledge, cost-effective
financing and risk mitigation solutions, as well as market access to sell their products. These partnerships include collaborations with government research institutes, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and international financial
institutions. We have already forged a number of key partnerships:

Non-commercial partnerships

Together with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and
Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit
(GIZ), the Bayer Foundation funds the Digital Farmer II program of our partner Mercy Corps AgriFin. This leverages the
spread of digital technologies to develop more efficient digital information and financial products and services for smallholder farmers. The program achieved its goal of serving up
to five million registered users in Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia
set for 2025 ahead of schedule. In 2024, we reached 4.1
million smallholder farmers via non-commercial partnerships.
In November, the Bayer Foundation, with the funding of
Bayer Crop Science, signed a grant agreement with The
Pula Foundation to support the 10 million Resilient Farmer
Initiative from 2025 through 2030. The initiative has the target of insuring 10 million smallholder farmers against climate
risks in seven countries in Africa and Asia by 2030. For more
information, please see chapter 9. Social Engagement.
Social impact measurement
Independent research by social impact measurement company 60 Decibels confirmed the value of three smallholder
projects in India, Kenya and Mexico/Honduras in 2024. In
each of the longitudinal surveys, a clear majority of participants ranging from around 60% to around 95% stated that
the programs have increased their yields and farming income and improved their way of farming as well as their
quality of life since they joined the projects. We expect impact measurement to complement our assessment of smallholder reach. For more information and additional studies,
please see our website.

Agriculture and climate change
Climate change is presenting major challenges for farmers
worldwide. Crop losses not only threaten the farmers’ future
and that of their families but also pose a risk to the global
food supply. At the same time, food cultivation generates

greenhouse gas emissions. Farming therefore plays a key role
on the road to a climate-neutral global economy ( SDG 13).

technology. For more information, please see the Focus on:
Agriculture chapter.

Through innovations in the areas of seeds, crop protection
and agricultural practices and through digital solutions, we
are helping to make farming both climate-neutral and climate-resilient. In this, we are working with farmers and partners throughout the entire value chain.

New technologies
We help farmers to increase their resilience against the effects of climate change, for example through our innovative
seeds for plants that can better withstand extreme weather
conditions, and through improved agricultural practices.
For more information, please see the chapter Focus on: Agriculture.

Decarbonization
We aim to enable our farming customers to reduce their onfield greenhouse gas emissions per mass unit of crop produced by 30% by 2030 compared to the overall base year
emission intensity. The overall base-year greenhouse gas intensity includes the weighted emission intensities of 17 cropcountry combinations. In 2024, the crop-country combination
Australia-Cotton was removed from the scope due to the unavailability of data. Base years are defined individually for
each crop-country combination, using data from either harvest year 2021 or 2022, depending on the availability of data.
Base years were adjusted in 2024 due to additional data requirements based on an updated GHG calculator methodology and lack of data availability from prior years. This reduction target applies to the highest greenhouse gas-emitting
crop systems in the regions Bayer serves with its products
(with the exception of the crop-country combinations ItalyCorn and Spain-Corn that were not selected based on these
factors but were additionally included because data were already available). Key levers in this endeavor include climatefriendly cultivation practices such as the adoption of reduced
or no-tillage or the sowing of cover crops. These enable CO2
to be captured in the soil, making the agricultural industry a
key player in the fight against climate change.
In addition, Bayer is driving forward the implementation of
regenerative agriculture programs in every region we serve.
Our Global Ecosystem Services support farmers and companies across the value chain to accelerate the adoption of
more regenerative agriculture practices and digital

We also invest in new technologies and conduct research
into questions such as how plants could use nitrogen from
the air for their growth with the help of soil microorganisms.
This would enable the use of nitrogen fertilizer to be greatly
reduced in the future. Currently, this substance is essential
for plant growth, yet its production and use result in significant greenhouse gas emissions.
Through our Leaps by Bayer participation in Fork & Good,
we are investing in research into animal protein produced
from cell cultures to cover the growing demand for protein
without stockbreeding.

Further reducing the ecological
footprint
We aim to reduce the treated-area-weighted environmental
impact per hectare of Bayer’s global crop protection portfolio by 30% by 2030 against a 2014–2018 average baseline.
The foundation for delivering the commitment is more sustainable crop protection, which our CropKey approach will
bring to market. Additionally, changes in agricultural practices, application methods for crop protection products and
the use of digital solutions help ensure that these products
are applied precisely and sparingly to the areas needing
treatment. For more information, please see the chapter Focus on: Agriculture.

Bayer promotes a concept of regenerative agriculture
(mainly downstream in our value chain). This is defined as an
outcome-based production system that aims to increase
food production, farm incomes and resilience in a changing
climate, while at the same time restoring nature.
Key outcomes we strive for are yield increase, improved social and economic well-being of farmers and communities,
and positive impact on nature, which can be achieved, for
instance, by improving soil health, reducing on-field greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon capture to mitigate climate change. We are also looking to restore biodiversity and conserve water. For more information, please see
the chapter Focus on: Agriculture.
// Bayer presented its new water strategy at the UN Water
Conference 2023 in New York. This strategy makes water
an integral part of our business, investment decisions and
supplier selection. The strategy considers our position as
a key player in the areas of health and agriculture and is
intended to have an impact beyond our own business. In
order to achieve the greatest possible impact, the
measures cover the entire agricultural value chain right
through to the farmers. We therefore aim to support our
smallholder customers in increasing water productivity by
25% by 2030 against a 2019–2021 average baseline by
transforming rice cropping in the relevant geographies
where Bayer operates. Water productivity is defined as kg
of crop yield per volume of water applied (kg/m3). The
baseline validation is still ongoing. Our water target is currently focusing on the DirectAcres Initiative, which aims at
supporting farmers shift successfully from transplanted
puddled rice to mechanized direct seeded rice.

Sustainability Firmly Anchored in Governance
As the core element of our corporate strategy, sustainability
is integrated into all our major processes. This is ensured
not just through binding targets and a broad set of directives
but also through fundamental Group management decisions.
Responsibility in the Group
As Bayer's Chief Sustainability Officer, Bill Anderson, the
Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO), is responsible
for implementing the strategic objectives. The Public Affairs,
Sustainability & Safety (PASS) Enabling Function is tasked
with the operational design of sustainability.
ESG Committee of the Supervisory Board
In 2022, an ESG Committee was established within Bayer's
Supervisory Board to deal with ecological and social responsibility matters and sustainable corporate governance. This
mainly pertains to the incorporation of sustainability into the
business strategy; the establishment of sustainability targets; nonmandatory environmental, social and governance
reporting and, where applicable, the auditing thereof; the
opportunities and risks; and the organizational structures
and processes, insofar as the Audit Committee is not already responsible for these matters. Within its scope of responsibility, the ESG Committee advises and oversees management and prepares possible resolutions by the
Supervisory Board.
The ESG Committee is composed of the Chairman of the
Supervisory Board and seven other Supervisory Board
members. It includes an equal number of stockholder and
employee representatives. Ertharin Cousin is Chair of the
ESG Committee.
The Supervisory Board is also closely involved in the implementation of the sustainability targets, independent of the

ESG Committee. It addresses this issue several times a year
along with the nonfinancial statement of the company as
part of the Annual Report.
Integration of ESG into compensation
Qualitative sustainability targets have been factored into the
compensation systems for the Board of Management and
entitled managerial employees since 2020. Since 2021, the
quantitative targets have accounted for 20% of the longterm variable compensation (LTI) of Bayer’s Board of Management and LTI-entitled managerial employees. For more
information, please see the Compensation Report in the
2024 Annual Report.
Implementation of human rights
According to our mission and regarding compliance with human rights due diligence obligations – especially the German
law (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz [LkSG]) – Bayer
named Matthias Berninger as Human Rights Officer. He reports directly to the CEO.
Measuring progress
To measure progress in the attainment of our Group targets,
we have defined key sustainability data that makes our performance transparent. Our “sustainability cockpit” brings together key data in one place and facilitates decision-making
by the management. The data is compiled in the countries
and centrally validated. We have thus established a reliable
due diligence process for our sustainability targets.

Sustainability Council composed of independent international experts. This body brings together expertise and experience in the areas of biodiversity, digitalization, health
systems, the food and agriculture industries, fair trade strategies, women’s rights, sustainable technologies, sustainable
finance and transformation strategies. The nine-member
body advises the Board of Management, oversees the implementation of the sustainability strategy and reports transparently each year on its work and recommendations, as
well as our progress.
Bioethics Council
Given the pace at which science is evolving and the challenging ethical questions associated with the possibilities
created by these innovations, we established the Bayer Bioethics Council in summer 2022. This external advisory body
consists of independent experts who bring in a societal perspective that helps Bayer to identify the relevant bioethical
questions and to develop answers.
Stakeholder dialogue
Bayer also seeks and maintains dialogue with stakeholders
at various levels beyond the Sustainability Council. Of particular importance is contact with those who publicly evaluate
Bayer with respect to sustainability aspects, especially including nongovernmental organizations and sustainabilityoriented rating agencies. We take all criticism seriously and
regard it as an incentive to improve.

Sustainability Council
We need a large network to realize our objectives. We have
therefore intensified our cooperation with social organizations in order to understand different perspectives and jointly
achieve a greater impact. In 2020, we convened a

ESG Rating Results in Recent Years
For many stakeholders, it is difficult to decide whether a
company can be seen or classified as “sustainable”. For
decades, the environmental, social and governance (ESG)
rating agencies have therefore been focusing on exactly this

question: using comprehensive and proprietary methodologies, they assess multiple indicators, especially in relation to
sustainability topics, and measure a company’s respective
risk exposure as well as its performance in terms of how

these sustainability risks are being managed. The methodologies used by ESG rating agencies differ, especially regarding which sustainability topics are considered to be material
for the assessment.
The results published by these ESG rating agencies are
commonly referred to as “ESG ratings.” Listed companies
such as Bayer are assessed by multiple ESG rating agencies, which often publish heterogeneous results. In addition,
we also undergo an assessment by EcoVadis, which is a
service provider analyzing our sustainability performance as
a supplier.
Bayer has been rated by ESG rating agencies for years, and
we have maintained a close interaction with leading ESG rating agencies we consider to be the most important to
achieve a fair and transparent assessment of our company.
We carefully listen to their requirements and adjust our sustainability management practices and our sustainability reporting accordingly. We have achieved significant progress
in recent years and continue working to further improve our
scorings.

For us, the progress made up until today is also a very
strong signal of the relevance and the acknowledgement of
Bayer’s sustainability strategy. Our focus for the years to
come will lie in collaborative engagement with the ESG rating agencies to improve wherever possible and to avoid
“red flags”.

Interview

Transparency is key to building trust
Bayer maintains a close dialogue with stakeholders and
investors. Why is this important?
Berninger: The exchange with a company’s stakeholders and
the understanding of their expectations is key to driving transparency efforts in a meaningful way. Our ESG investor engagement activities are guided by their assessment and by our wellfounded assumption that transparency is the basis for trust,
reputation, and ultimately for investment.
Kalidas: Not to forget the constant exchange with our external
Sustainability Council, which advises us on all sustainability
matters. This group of experts helps us to further develop the
sustainability elements of our business strategy and provides
guidance on the contribution that we can make toward our mission “Health for all, Hunger for none.”
Which topics are currently of particular interest to your
stakeholders and investors?
Kalidas: Investors, ESG rating agencies as well as NGOs are
asking for information on classic sustainability topics. They
want to understand how Bayer is approaching and shaping
the transformation. And they want to see progress in our targets, measures and actions like our climate transition plan,
our 100 million targets, our approach to regenerative agriculture, our compliance with relevant regulations, our governance
framework and litigation remains as an area of concern.
Berninger: Actually, we are experiencing a water crisis that is
closely linked to the climate crisis, and investors too are realizing that these are among the world’s most pressing challenges.
At the heart of their expectations of Bayer, however, are improvements in caring for people’s nutritional and health needs
worldwide. That is why Bayer’s Nutrient Gap Initiative (NGI) was
recognized at the 2024 Reuters Global Sustainability Awards in
the Social Impact category for improving access to essential vitamins and minerals, particularly in underserved communities.

How do ESG ratings contribute to measuring progress
and supporting investment decisions?
Berninger: Bayer’s track record in ESG ratings in recent years
acknowledges the company’s strong commitment to sustainability. This also confirms our work on health, nutrition, climate
change and many other sustainability topics and encourages us
as a global leader in this area. Annually, in our ESG Update
Call, we share the significant strides we have made in sustainability with our investors.
Kalidas: Our CEO and CSO (Chief Sustainability Officer) Bill
Anderson has been a strong proponent of integrating sustainability into the heart of our operations. It is a precondition for living our mission because investors today are increasingly looking at the sustainability risks associated with their investments
and the impact they can have. By presenting our climate transition and transformation plan, we further intensified our discussion with investors. For example, our commitment to net-zero
emissions by 2050 is more than just a promise, it's a datadriven journey we're tracking and disclosing. But there are a lot
of other topics like access to healthcare and human rights that
are relevant for our investors.
The European Corporate Sustainability Reporting
Directive (CSRD) obliges companies to report about
material matter. What do you think about its impact?
Kalidas: For us, transparent reporting has always been key
to building trust and preparing our organization to tackle the
challenges we face. In recent years, we have received positive
responses from investors, sustainability analysts, ESG rating
agencies, politicians and many other stakeholders for our comprehensive voluntary sustainability reporting. Our voluntary reporting
accompanied the mandatory section of the management report in
accordance with the Non-Financial Reporting Directive. Through
CSRD and the interconnected European Sustainability Reporting
Standards (ESRS) our mandatory reporting will certainly reach a

new level of transparency. But CSRD/ESRS’s definition of materiality does not include every detail which is part of ESG assessments. That’s why ESG rating agencies demand more or slightly
different information than the CSRD/ESRS requires. For this reason, we are still publishing a complementary Impact Report for fiscal year 2024. This report covers additional topics. We look forward to this complementary reporting providing a comprehensive
basis for investors and ESG rating agencies to understand our operations and thereby enable us to further improve our ESG scorings and achieve the best possible results.
Berninger: For Bayer, the year 2024 has been a time of transition. As a key player in global health and food security, we had
to deal with new challenges in sustainability reporting. The
CSRD/ESRS focus on material impact as well as on a financial
perspective. Solely relying on this materiality could lead investors to abandon or ignore companies pursuing initiatives that,
as of now, are not considered to be material but would help us
all to achieve net-zero or other Sustainable Development Goals,
especially those connected to global health and the fight
against hunger. Such a reduced focus could thereby undermine
investments in sustainable technologies and transformation.
Kalidas: We need to explain Bayer's mission and demonstrate
how we benefit people and the environment in our daily work—
beyond compliance with the CSRD. This will inspire our employees to collaborate on common goals and engage in innovations
for a sustainable business. I believe that transparency regarding
targets, actions and measures, along with clear communication,
is crucial for a successful transformation.

from investments accounted for using the equity method)
less the costs of procured and consumed goods and services, depreciation, amortization, impairment losses and impairment loss reversals.

Enabling Functions
The Enabling Functions, such as Public Affairs, Sustainability
& Safety (PASS); Group Finance; Human Resources and Information Technology, serve as Group-wide competence
centers and bundle business support processes and services for the divisions. Our Leaps by Bayer unit, which
invests in disruptive innovations, also forms part of the Enabling Functions.

Our total operating performance amounted to €48.8 billion
in 2024. The cost of materials and other expenses totaled
€27.7 billion. We recorded depreciation, amortization, impairment losses and impairment loss reversals of €8.8 billion.
We posted a value added of €12.3 billion in 2024.

For more information on the divisions’ products and activities and the distribution of sales across the divisions and our
global sites, please see our 2024 Annual Report.

In 2024, the value added we generated enabled us to make
the following financial contributions to our stakeholders: employees €12.5 billion, taxes €1.1 billion, providers of equity
and debt €1.9 billion and stockholders €0.1 billion (Bayer AG
dividend proposal for 2024).

1.3 Value Added
By delivering innovative products and solutions, Bayer
creates value for its stakeholders at all stages of the value
chain. We operate production sites worldwide, invest in research and development, work with international and local
suppliers, and contribute to the economic development of
our target markets. As an employer, we provide jobs in industrialized, emerging and developing economies and therefore create purchasing power through the salaries we pay.
We contribute to public finances and thus support public infrastructure through the payment of taxes and other levies.

2.1 Corporate Governance Practices and Principles

2. Corporate Governance
Bayer is committed to responsible corporate governance.
By adhering to laws, safeguarding values and strengthening
our reputation, we aim to secure our company’s long-term
success and to foster a high level of trust among all stakeholders. Our endeavors in this regard are further supported
by our increased integration of sustainability aspects into all
processes and at all levels of the company.
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on G1 Governance.

2.1 Corporate Governance
Practices and Principles
Bayer AG is subject to German stock corporation law and
therefore has a dual governance system consisting of the
Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The Board
of Management manages the company based on a strategy
that is geared toward its long-term success. The Supervisory
Board oversees and monitors the Board of Management. The
Supervisory Board has its own ESG Committee, comprising
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and seven further
members of the Supervisory Board. This focuses on Bayer’s
sustainable governance and business activities in the areas of
environment, social and governance (ESG) within the scope of
responsibility of the Supervisory Board.
Corporate governance practices that go beyond the legal requirements are derived from our mission and our common
values, which form the basis for the respectful working relationship among our employees and with our external partners. Compliance with responsible practices at every stage
of the value chain is crucial in corporate governance. The
main guidelines are summarized in our Code of Conduct and

Supplier Code of Conduct, addressing topics such as human rights, compliance and fairness and respect at work. In
addition, Bayer has established compliance management
and risk management systems.
In our Annual Report, we report in detail on the main elements of the Bayer Group’s corporate governance structures and conformity with the recommendations of the
German Corporate Governance Code, relevant corporate
governance practices, the composition and procedures of
the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board and their
committees, and also on compensation in the Compensation Report along with the objectives to be defined and the
underlying concepts.
Planning and steering
The Board of Management uses defined, primarily nonfinancial targets and key performance indicators to steer the
company’s alignment toward increased sustainability. These
are integrated into the Bayer Group’s planning and steering
process as management and key performance indicators.
Our Group-wide sustainability targets are integrated into the
compensation system for the Board of Management. In so
doing, we aim to continuously increase value for stockholders and other stakeholders and ensure the continuity of our
company for the long term. Quantitative targets derived from
the sustainability strategy are integrated into the long-term
variable compensation (LTI) of the Board of Management
and LTI-entitled managerial employees with a weighting of
20%. For more information, please see the 2024 Annual Report/ Compensation Report (Chapter C). For details of the financial indicators we employ to plan, steer and monitor the
development of our business, please see chapter 1.2.2
Management Systems of the 2024 Annual Report.

What we are committed to: Our Code of Conduct
The Code of Conduct describes the principles of which conduct to follow in Bayer‘s business activities. It defines how
Bayer employees work together with colleagues and external
partners. The Code of Conduct serves as a compass for maintaining integrity. It helps employees to make well-founded decisions, to focus on the essentials and to strengthen the identity
of the company. It is available to all employees worldwide in 20
languages, and a web-based training, which was assigned to
Bayer employees in the reporting year, supports compliance
with the new set of rules.
Next to the Code of Conduct, additional binding policies and
procedures (also referred to as “Group Regulations”), which
apply to Bayer employees depending on their individual job
responsibilities, foster behavior in accordance with laws and
internal regulations.
Both the Code of Conduct and the following policies are subject to a formal enactment process by the respective legal
representative (i.e. managing director or board) in the individual Group companies. This enactment is centrally documented and monitored:
//

Risk management
Risk management is an integral part of corporate management at Bayer. We regard risks as negative deviations from
projected or target values for potential future developments.
We augment our risk definition process by also taking into

account any potential adverse effects that our business operations could have on people and/or the environment.
We have implemented an integrated risk management system designed to ensure the continued existence and future
target attainment of the Group through the early identification, assessment and treatment of risks. Our risk management system is oriented towards internationally recognized
standards and principles such as the ISO 31000 standard of
the International Organization for Standardization and is defined and implemented with the help of Group Regulations.
The Board of Management of Bayer AG holds overall responsibility for an effective risk management system. It examines the appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk
management system at least once a year, as does the
Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee.
Examples of such risk control measures can also be found in
this Impact Report in the descriptions of how various sustainability issues are managed.
For detailed information on the basic elements of the risk
management system, including the risk management process, and details on our risk status, please see chapter
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report of the 2024 Annual Report.
Material legal risks are described in the 2024 Annual Report
under Note [30] to B Consolidated Financial Statements (Legal Risks). The legal proceedings outlined there are those
currently considered to involve material risks and do not represent an exhaustive list.

2.2 Compliance
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on G1 Governance.

Trust serves as the foundation for our business activities and
is crucial to our success. It requires a daily commitment to
building awareness and complying with laws, regulations
and ethical principles. Integrity is central to our company
culture and guides our actions. We do not tolerate illegal or
unethical actions. Any violations will be investigated and resolved fairly and consistently.
Our Code of Conduct serves as a guideline to keep us on
the right track and in full compliance with all applicable legal
requirements. It is complemented by the Legal, Compliance
and Insurance policy which provides a concise overview of
relevant legal and compliance topics guiding our business
operations. This approach provides clarity, transparency and
a comprehensive understanding of our integrity and operational standards.
Bayer compliance management
The Board of Management is unreservedly committed to
compliance. Bayer will forgo any business transaction that
would violate the Code of Conduct approved by the Board
of Management and observed throughout the Bayer Group.
The Code of Conduct sets the standard for:
// How we interact with customers, patients and consumers
// How we work together
// How we engage with stakeholders
It contains, in particular but not exclusively, binding specifications on the following topics: Competition Law, Anticorruption, Fraud/Theft, Anti-Money Laundering, Export Control/Economic Sanctions/International Trade and Customs
Compliance, Insider Trading, Intellectual Property, Data Privacy, Fairness and Respect at Work, Conflicts of Interest,
Environmental Protection, and Human Rights.
All employees are required to observe the Code of Conduct
and immediately report any activity or behavior that could
constitute a material compliance violation.

Depending on the severity of the compliance violation, an infringement can have disciplinary, civil or criminal consequences for the employees in question. Proven misconduct
can also have an impact on compensation. Failure to report,
properly investigate or remedy a suspected material compliance violation can result in serious consequences, including
employment consequences, criminal sanctions for the company and liability for individual employees, as well as fines
and reputational damage.
The global compliance management system is steered by
a central compliance organization within the Bayer Group.
This organization is headed by our General Counsel in their
role as Group Compliance Officer, who, in this function, reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and to the
Supervisory Board´s Audit Committee. The CFO is responsible for the compliance organization, while the Audit Committee oversees the effectiveness and further development of
compliance within the Group. Within the compliance organization, specialized compliance managers are responsible for
establishing specific standards.
Potential compliance risks (such as corruption, competition
law or data privacy infringements) are identified together
with the operational units to ensure the systematic and preventive detection and assessment of risks. Potential risks
are then entered into global databases that we use to develop suitable measures for specific processes, business activities or countries, for example. In addition, we assess our
business partners according to risk criteria as we look to
identify potential compliance risks.
Adherence to the Code of Conduct is among the subjects
covered in audits conducted by Bayer’s Internal Audit and in
the analyses and reviews by the legal and compliance organization. The heads of these organizations provide regular
reports on the results to the Audit Committee.

2.2 Compliance

The planning of these audits by Internal Audit follows a function- and risk-based approach that, among other things,
also takes the Corruption Perceptions Index of Transparency
International into account. Function-specific audits are conducted worldwide across all important corporate units, such
as for marketing and distribution. The respective relevant
stakeholders (e.g. management, employees, distributors or
service providers) participate in audits depending on the
type of audit. The larger business areas and units are audited at shorter intervals, and the smaller units at longer intervals. A total of 73 audit reports were compiled in 2024, of
which two concerned preventive compliance program audits
and eight concerned incident-related compliance investigations.
Handling of suspected and actual compliance
violations
All Bayer Group employees are obligated to report material
compliance violations. The principles for dealing with compliance incidents are described in the Group Regulations on
Legal, Compliance and Insurance, and Management of
Compliance Incidents, which establish the respective roles
and responsibilities and explain the handling of suspected
and actual compliance violations.
Suspected compliance violations can be reported – anonymously if desired and if permitted by respective national law –
to a global Speak Up Channel operated by an independent
service provider. Every effort will be made to protect confidential information relating to a reported incident, and communication will be limited to a need-to-know basis only. Reports can be made by anyone either via webpage, Speak Up
App or through a phone call made in the caller’s preferred
language. The channel is also accessible to the general public. In 2024, the compliance organization received a total of
570 reports in this way (including 411 anonymous reports),
with 35 reports coming from Germany and 535 from other
countries. Overall, 41% of suspected violations reported to

the Speak Up Channel were not compliance-relevant, while
59% were processed by way of a compliance investigation.
In addition, suspected compliance violations can be submitted to an internal mailbox – the Speak-Up Inbox. Alternatively, suspected violations may be reported to a manager;
Human Resources; Law, Patents & Compliance; employee
representatives; Internal Audit; or Corporate Security. Furthermore, suspected compliance violations are recorded and
processed as part of the monitoring activities conducted by
the Compliance function.
Upon internal evaluation, a total of 982 suspected compliance violations were recorded in 2024. An actual compliance violation was confirmed in 47% (as of December 31,
2024, subject to changes due to ongoing investigations) of
the compliance-relevant investigations. Compliance violations
include infringements of internal and external requirements and
are systematically sanctioned. The action taken depends on
factors including the severity of the violation and applicable
law. All cases are recorded according to uniform criteria
throughout the Bayer Group and dealt with under the rules set
forth in the Group Regulations on Legal, Compliance and Insurance, and Management of Compliance Incidents. Where an
investigation confirms that a compliance violation has occurred, the company has a graduated set of measures at its
disposal. These include a verbal warning or written reprimand,
transfer to a different unit, cancellation of a planned promotion,
a reduction in the short-term incentive payment, downgrading
to a lower collectively agreed pay rate or managerial contract
level, and ordinary or extraordinary termination. Bayer also reserves the right to assert further claims against the employee
for cost reimbursement or damages and/or to initiate criminal
proceedings.
In the last three years, the following selected categories of
compliance violations were confirmed:

The company ensures that no employees are disadvantaged
or exposed to retaliatory measures because they reported a
suspected compliance violation in good faith. If it is determined that an employee is responsible for disadvantaging or
retaliating against another employee due to the reporting in
good faith of a suspected compliance violation, appropriate
steps are taken against the employee responsible according
to the aforementioned catalogue of measures.
Compliance training and communications activities
We support all employees in acting with integrity and proactively avoiding potential violations by implementing Bayerwide training measures and communication campaigns that
are tailored to target groups and based on identified needs.
The Code of Conduct forms the foundation for our compliance communication and training activities. Both supervisors
and compliance managers are available to answer employees’ questions about lawful behavior.
Training measures on anti-corruption, the importance of
openly expressing concerns (Speak-Up), antitrust law, conflicts of interest, fairness and respect at work, foreign trade
law compliance, product-related communication and data
privacy are fundamental elements of our compliance management system.

Each year, the company publishes a new, obligatory training
course for all Bayer employees. In 2024, approximately 84%
(34,157) of Bayer’s managerial employees worldwide completed at least one compliance training program. We
launched a new web-based training course on the Code of
Conduct in 92 countries in November 2024. The training
course is available in 15 languages.
Our annual, company-wide Speak-Up campaign aims to
foster an open reporting culture and communicates the various options for reporting compliance violations. This is designed to create an environment in which compliance violations can be addressed without reservations.
Data privacy
Data is very important in today’s world. It is often accessible
worldwide, and its financial value is growing. As a result,
people have an increasing interest in their data remaining
secure. Bayer is committed to protecting the personal data
of all its stakeholders, be they employees, business partners, stockholders, suppliers or customers. Fulfilling this
commitment is an important business principle and a central
condition for the company’s success.
Since there is no globally binding data privacy law, legislation varies widely from country to country. To establish a
standard for all countries in which Bayer operates, a Groupwide approach is required. This is the only way to protect
personal data sufficiently while at the same time facilitating
efficient business processes.
The Code of Conduct and the Legal, Compliance and Insurance Policy approved by the Board of Management set out
minimum requirements for the way personal data is processed throughout the Bayer Group. Bayer strives to protect
people’s privacy and prevent their data from being misused.
We are aware of the potential harm caused by unlawful data
processing and have established a standard to minimize this
risk.

The data privacy management system addresses risk situations that are relevant to the company’s business. The system covers the entire data life cycle from collection through
transfer, analysis and storage to deletion. The core elements
of the data privacy management system – the maintenance
of a processing registry, the management of data privacy incidents, requests from data subjects and risk mitigation –
are mandatory. Training and guidance, along with systembased monitoring, ensure the regulations are adhered to.
The training covers the fundamentals of data privacy, the
principles and life cycle of personal data processing, the
rights of data subjects and the appropriate conduct in the
event of a data privacy incident. Harmonized documentation
of the data privacy activities (management of the register of
processing activities, data privacy impact assessments, incidents, data subject requests and interactions with authorities) enables an understanding of the degree of data privacy
maturity and the monitoring of quality by management and
the (local) legal departments.

Regulation on Integrity & Responsibility in Communications
and Marketing, which guides all employees to ensure compliance across all communication and marketing activities,
including the development and usage of promotional articles
in accordance with current internal and relevant external legal and ethical standards. Where several regulations are applicable, we comply with the strictest standards. Third parties acting on Bayer’s behalf in countries with a high
corruption risk undergo a separate due diligence process
that involves criteria related to anti-corruption.

With our Data Privacy Day in January 2024, we underscored
our commitment to data privacy by offering interactive sessions on data privacy basics for the Bayer employees, along
with an interactive webcast featuring our Data Privacy Officer and our Chief Information Security Officer.

The codes of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) serve as a binding
minimum global standard for all of Bayer’s human pharmaceutical products in their area of application. In addition,
Bayer observes the codes of the European Federation of
Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) in its interaction with healthcare professionals and patient organizations. Regarding the advertising of human pharmaceutical
products, Bayer complies with the regulations set out in the
IFPMA Code of Practice as the minimum global standard,
along with those set forth in regional and national codes.

Marketing compliance and the validity of recognized
standards
We do not tolerate any improper exertion of influence on our
business partners. As part of our compliance management
system, we record and investigate any suspected violation
of our responsible marketing principles, irrespective of
whether the complaints come from internal or external
sources.
The most important Group Regulations in this context are
the Code of Conduct and the Legal, Compliance and Insurance Policy (e.g. on anti-corruption, competition law, data
privacy). These regulations are supplemented by the Group

Industry codes for pharmaceutical products and medical devices that have been adopted by major national and international associations and organizations also apply to marketing and distribution at Bayer. In many countries, these
standards are further underpinned by local codes – all of
which apply to prescription pharmaceuticals and some of
which also apply to nonprescription medicines, dietary supplements, medical devices and medicated skincare products.

The aforementioned codes contain provisions governing,
among other matters, advertising materials, the distribution
of samples, cooperation with members of specialist groups
in connection with speaker and consultancy contracts, and
scientific studies. Bayer observes the applicable transparency rules (e.g. the Physician Payments Sunshine Act in the
United States) and participates in voluntary programs such

as the EFPIA Disclosure Code. In accordance with the
EFPIA Disclosure Code, Bayer discloses benefits in kind to
medical specialists and health organizations in connection
with the development and marketing of prescription (and,
where legally required, nonprescription) medicines. Bayer is
convinced that better results can be achieved for patients
through cooperation with, and the continuous training of,
medical specialists. Total spending in Europe subject to disclosure according to the EFPIA Disclosure Code and numerous local codes and/or legislation amounted to €202 million
in 2023. These expenditures are published on a country-bycountry basis on a global disclosure site of Bayer
(https://www.bayer.com/en/sustainability/facts-on-disclosure) and/or reported to the respective local authorities.
Internal Audit at Bayer AG regularly conducts audits to verify
conformity with internal compliance rules and external regulations in the area of marketing. The respective audit program of Internal Audit is focused on compliance with local
pharmaceutical codes and with antitrust and anti-corruption
rules by the marketing departments of the divisions and
country organizations. Coverage of this issue is achieved by
way of an audit cycle that regularly assesses the country organizations, as well as audits of management systems
(compliance program audits). The audit plan is discussed
with the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board
and approved by both bodies.
In line with the principles of sustainable development and
the responsible use of crop protection products and seeds,
Crop Science follows the guideline on Product Stewardship
- Commitment, Principles and Key Requirements. This
guideline, which also comprises our rules of conduct for responsible marketing, is based on the International Code of
Conduct on Pesticide Management issued by the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the
International Code of Conduct on Plant Biotechnology issued by CropLife International.

Relevant training measures on product-related communication, antitrust law, data privacy and anti-corruption are fundamental elements of our compliance management system.
Principles communicated in these training courses provide
an overview of globally applicable minimum requirements for
cooperation with key stakeholders, including in particular but
not limited to those in the healthcare industry, such as physicians, hospitals or patient organizations. In addition to explaining general compliance principles, the anti-corruption
courses provide specific advice on approaches to nonreciprocal benefits and the exchange of services with healthcare
professionals. The country organizations or, in some cases,
the legal department are primarily responsible for implementing these training measures. Employees with customer
contact and/or business responsibility undergo special training focusing on anti-corruption, e.g. covering local pharmaceutical codes and their rules for cooperation with
healthcare professionals.

funds governed by employees and further regulated by the
US Federal Election Commission (FEC) and some state governments.

Lobbying
Bayer is committed to transparent lobbying. In line with this,
our Code of Conduct for Responsible Lobbying sets out
binding rules for our involvement in political matters, covers
compliance-relevant risks and creates transparency in our
interactions with representatives of political institutions. In
addition, and based on feedback from various stakeholder
groups, we have produced a detailed report on our political
advocacy work.

In other countries, industry associations of which we are a
member (such as the German Chemical Industry Association) sometimes make donations on their own responsibility
in compliance with the respective statutory regulations, and
particularly laws concerning political parties.

As set out in our Code of Conduct for Responsible Lobbying, Bayer as a company expressly prohibits donations to
political parties, politicians or candidates for political office.
However, as political contributions are protected under US
law, local company employees can support individual candidates for parliamentary office at the federal level by making
private donations through political action committees
(PACs). These voluntary donations are made only by employees, not the company. PACs are separate, segregated

Decisions on how these contributions are allocated are
made by an independent committee composed of employees. At BAYERPAC, the name of the corresponding committee at Bayer, allocation criteria are applied to reflect societal
challenges, among other factors. For example, candidates’
positions on issues such as climate change and the protection of biodiversity play an important role here. BAYERPAC
also supports candidates from both parties but does not
support presidential candidates. These donations are subject to stringent conditions and mandatory transparency
measures. The BAYERPAC contributions are regularly reported to the FEC. Full details can be viewed on the FEC
website. Bayer employees donated a total of US$289,125 to
political candidates at all levels through BAYERPAC in 2024.

For Bayer, national liaison offices are key touchpoints between
the company and political stakeholders. Where required we
publish details of material costs, project expenses, employee
numbers and any of the other statistics required in each
country according to the respective provisions of the domestic transparency register, such as those of the German Parliament (Bundestag), European institutions and the US Congress. We even go beyond statutory requirements by also
publishing data for countries and organizational units where –
as yet – there is no legal disclosure requirement in our political
advocacy transparency report. In 2024, the costs incurred at
the liaison offices totaled approximately €2.1 million in Germany; €6.4 million in the European Union; €21.1 million in the
United States; €1.2 million in Brazil; and €2.5 million in China.

2.3 Sustainability Management

The Public Affairs, Sustainability & Safety (PASS) Enabling
Function helps the CSO and the Board of Management
identifying risks and opportunities, develop strategies and
define targets and guidelines for sustainability management,
and also ensures the governance of all sustainability topics.
Sustainability management is embedded in the existing
management and governance structures as well as in the
core processes of the organization.

Sustainability is one of our strategic focuses, manifesting
itself in the consistent alignment of our business activities
to make positive contributions for people and the environment. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities ensure effective sustainability management throughout the organization.
The initial phase of becoming an impact generator has been
successfully completed over the past five years. Additionally,
it is noted that the overall perception and support of environmental, social and governance topics, along with significant geopolitical shifts, are influencing sustainability agendas
on a global scale. Bayer has also entered a new chapter
with the introduction of dynamic shared ownership (DSO). In
light of these developments, it is deemed necessary to update the sustainability strategy to maintain a focus on value
creation for our customers, investors, and employees, while
also preserving trust and upholding the company’s reputation. The top level of responsibility for the sustainability strategy is held by the Chairman of the Board of Management
(CEO) in his role as Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), together with the entire Board of Management. An external
Sustainability Council provides the Board of Management
with constructive criticism in all sustainability matters. In addition, a Human Rights Officer oversees risk management in
the area of human rights and informs the Board of Management about his or her work.
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on our governance in [GOV-1], [GOV-2], [GOV3], [GOV-4] and [GOV-5].
A separate Supervisory Board committee oversees the areas
of environmental protection, social affairs and corporate governance (ESG Committee) regarding both the integration of

Operational implementation takes place in the divisions and
along the value chain. Each of our divisions has an established sustainability organization, with sustainability aspects
also being integrated into the processes of Enabling Functions such as Internal Audit & Risk Management, Human Resources, Procurement, and Mergers, Acquisitions & Licensing.
Our Group Regulation on Sustainability defines sustainability’s importance at Bayer, the standards to which sustainability is managed and the roles and responsibilities involved.
The Group Regulation was approved by the Head of Public
Affairs, Safety & Sustainability and is valid throughout the
Group.
Wherever required, the CSO and Board of Management are
integrated into the decision-making process. Measures under the responsibility of the Supervisory Board also need to
be approved by this body.
The attainment of sustainability targets is also integrated as
an additional parameter into the long-term variable compensation (LTI) of the LTI-entitled managerial employees, similar
to the compensation of the Board of Management.
Our commitment to the UN Global Compact and the Responsible Care™ initiative of the chemical industry and our

involvement in the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development (WBCSD) underline our mission as a company
that acts sustainably. This is reinforced in our report on compliance with the principles of the UN Global Compact.
Sustainability Council
A major element of our sustainability efforts is the independent Sustainability Council established in 2020. This council
currently comprises eight internationally recognized experts
in human rights, healthcare, nutrition, finance, agriculture
and the environment, representing a broad range of views,
differing geographical origins and diverse genders. The Sustainability Council advises the Board of Management on the
further development of its business strategy regarding sustainability as well as other sustainability-related topics. It
also evaluates performance and planned activities, and
counsels Bayer on how research and development can contribute to sustainability. The contributions of the Sustainability Council inform our strategic planning. The Sustainability
Council convenes twice a year for deliberations and reports
annually on the progress of its work. The CEO and other
members of the Board of Management also attend these
meetings. The Sustainability Council also handles specific
topics together with Bayer’s experts at additional meetings.
Double materiality analysis
In 2024, we conducted a double materiality analysis in accordance with the requirements of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). In the Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024 we report on our double
materiality analysis [SBM-3].

2.4 Stakeholders
As a company, Bayer is a part of society and public life. Ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders is therefore particularly
important to us. After all, their expectations and viewpoints affect our public acceptance and thus our commercial success.

Interactions with a variety of stakeholders
We want to live up to our social responsibility as a transparent company that acts sustainably and is respected for its
contribution to progress in healthcare and agriculture. We
want to listen, understand, take concerns seriously and engage in respectful dialogue – especially where this is difficult
or uncomfortable.
Our regular stakeholder activities range from dialogues at
the local, national and international level, and active involvement in committees and specialist workshops, all the way
through to comprehensive information programs, issue-related multi-stakeholder events and participation in international initiatives and collaborations. In our Stakeholder

Engagement table at the end of this chapter, we provide insight into selected topics relating to our most important
stakeholder groups.
In 2024, we engaged in intensive discussions with stakeholder groups (see graphic) that focused on topics such as
sustainable agriculture, healthcare, nutrition, climate change,
biodiversity and water, taxes, political lobbying, poverty alleviation and family planning.
Examples include our contributions to the World Economic
Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland (Zero
Hunger Pledge); our participation in the Economist Sustainability Week and the Climate Week in New York, United
States; our event series Fields of Opportunities: the Breakthrough Innovation Forum; the Field Technology Showcase
for investors at our Agronomy Center in Jerseyville, Illinois,
United States; and our sustainability event at a Bayer ForwardFarm in Germany.

COP29

Bayer took part in the UN Climate Conference COP29 in
Baku in Azerbaijan to drive partnerships and advance the
sustainable development goals. The respective agendas included important topics such as agriculture, water, nutrition
and biodiversity. Bayer is contributing to the following areas,
for example:
// We support a concept of regenerative agriculture. Bayer
signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on innovative farming technologies with the Canadian province of
Saskatchewan, with the goal of helping farmers produce
more while reducing their environmental footprint against
the backdrop of climate change.
// We are a founding member of the Vision for Adapted
Crops and Soils (VACS), an initiative of the US government, the African Union and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, whose goal is to boost
agricultural productivity and nutrition by developing

//

diverse, climate-resilient crop varieties and building
healthy soils.
We promote existing partnerships such as the LEAF
Coalition – the signing of memorandums of understanding
for future LEAF credits from 2022 to 2026 should lay the
basis for further investment in the reduction in deforestation of tropical rain forests.
We enter new partnerships to better understand how
health is affected by climate change. Bayer Foundation
and the Asian Venture Philanthropy Network (AVPN), for
example, are partnering to establish an ecosystem for social funders in Asia and drive investments in projects at
the climate/health intersection.
We promote research to recuperate degraded soils.
Bayer announced a cooperation agreement with the Brazilian nongovernmental organization (NGO) IPAM and the
Woodwell Climate Research Center to better understand
how deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado impacts
climate conditions and therefore agriculture.
As part of our Forest Protection Strategy, our PRO Carbono Commodities Program currently includes soybean
production by Brazilian growers and agricultural companies in the state of Mato Grosso, within the Cerrado and
Amazon biomes.
We engage in joint projects with other partners to improve global food security. Bayer signed an MoU with SILAL, a global leader in life sciences, to strengthen the agricultural landscape in the United Arab Emirates, focusing
on better agricultural practices, capacity-building programs and comprehensive vegetable seed trials.

COP16

The COP16 for the UN Convention on Biological Diversity
took place in Cali Colombia with a strong focus on resource
mobilization and implementation of a workable set of Global
Biodiversity Framework targets.

At COP16 Bayer urged policymakers to better understand
how business can contribute to
// a new mechanism and fund for benefit sharing from digital sequence information,
// reducing pollution risk,
// agreeing that innovation is critical for sustainable productivity in agriculture.
Furthermore, Bayer participated in partnering dialogues emphasizing the importance of regenerative agriculture in
providing farmers access to sustainable solutions and in driving change alongside similar stakeholders. Bayer supported
the Action agenda publication by CropLife International on
Nature positive.
Through multi-stakeholder dialogue and the coalition Bayer
formed with organizations such as the World Bank and the
Global Economic Forum, we further raised awareness about
the challenges faced by smallholder farmers. For example,
we conveyed to governmental organizations that smallholder
farmers need access to technology and innovations to improve their living conditions.
We have led various live discussions on socially relevant topics on LinkedIn – including in areas where Bayer is viewed
critically. These discussions focused on topics such as climate change, biodiversity, water and sustainable economic
activity.
Bayer is committed to being a reliable partner that is aware
of its societal responsibility toward the communities adjacent
to our sites. Hence, we maintain an open dialogue between
local management and community members, particularly at
our production sites, which is supported by each site’s respective country organization. This dialogue involves personal
discussions with residents, citizens’ initiatives, local councils
and the regional press. It also includes the Product Supply
Community Outreach program, which focuses on making a

direct positive impact in the communities where our employees live and work. Based on impact analyses, the material
needs at our sites are identified and suitable measures defined that range, for example, from internship offers for girls
to the planting of vegetable gardens, projects directed at
health promotion and healthy eating, and teaching units in
the Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines at schools. The target achievement of
the implemented measures is monitored. Our activities here
are ongoing. At more than 130 sites worldwide, we want to
create significant impact and added value with the program.
Stakeholder engagement in the divisions
We engage in everyday dialogue with our customers. Our
divisions navigate different regulatory frameworks. For example, direct contact between Pharmaceuticals or Consumer
Health and the respective customer environment, and especially patients, is regulated in different ways for each division.
With regard to the collection of customer satisfaction data,
different legal requirements apply to prescription medicines
from Pharmaceuticals than apply to nonprescription medicines, for example. Any primary market research and data
searches that must be conducted, including systematic internet analysis, strictly adhere to the legal requirements,
which can vary significantly depending on the market.
To facilitate global access to medicines, we cooperate with
various partner organizations and other stakeholders. In addition to our focus on neglected tropical diseases (please
see chapter Focus on: Access to Healthcare), we collaborated with other pharmaceutical companies – e.g. within the
Access Accelerated initiative – on solutions for access to
medicines for treating noncommunicable diseases in less
affluent countries.

Patient engagement
Central to the way we operate within the Pharmaceuticals division is the meaningful engagement of patients,
care partners and patient advocacy groups. Nurturing
such collaborations is vital for in-depth understanding
of the priorities of the people living with health conditions and of how we can best serve them and contribute toward better patient outcomes, building trust and
disseminating knowledge about the benefit-risk profiles of our medicines and healthcare solutions to support shared decision-making across the diverse populations in the countries where we operate. According
to the 2023 PatientView survey, 409 patient organizations worldwide reported collaborating with Bayer. Additionally, we actively participate in multi-stakeholder
forums focused on advancing patient-centric medicine
development.
By involving those with lived experiences alongside
healthcare professionals, we can tailor care strategies
to better meet patient needs, leading to informed decisions, improved education, and research centred
around the patient experience. In 2024, Bayer's R&D
team integrated input from patients, care partners, and
families into a Phase 1 clinical trial for a liver cancer
therapy. While we have historically collaborated with patient councils on educational materials and Phase II and
III trials, incorporating patient perspectives at this early
stage represents a new approach, yielding insights that
informed trial design to better reflect patient needs.
Patient engagement: prostate cancer
We understand that patient engagement requires a
tailored approach, as the needs of different patient
groups can vary significantly. In 2024, we have

specifically exemplified this in the area of prostate cancer across three key areas: Shared Decision Making
(SDM), effective education and communication, and
patient involvement.
A key evolution in our approach is our commitment to
enhancing accessibility to scientific information. In
2024, this included translating the Plain Language
Summary Publications (PLSP) from the ARASENS
trial—a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
Phase III study involving patients with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer—into multiple languages, ensuring access for non-English-speaking
communities. Additionally, we have incorporated plain
language sections in all related congress posters. Our
ongoing efforts to co-author plain language summaries
with patients further exemplify our dedication to making scientific information approachable and relevant for
affected communities.

We engage with farmers’ organizations, including the World
Farmers’ Organization and the Global Farmer Network. We
launched our own global advisory group for growers to formalize this dialogue worldwide and across different types of
farming enterprises – from conventional to organic.
One way in which Crop Science achieves customer centricity is through our Food Chain Partnership, which includes
several hundred initiatives throughout the entire value chain.
These strategic alliances and cooperation models are aimed
at driving improvements in food security, sustainability and
economic opportunities for farmers. The programs center on
innovative crop solutions and services for sustainable
agriculture.

In our Bayer Forward Farming programs, we work together
directly with a network of independent farmers who test
more sustainable agricultural practices. Our goal is to create
ecosystems that reduce business risks for our customers
and all participating partners. With this goal in mind, we
form partnerships with nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs), participants in our value chain and the public sector, and jointly develop new solutions such as the Global Alliance Against TR4 to contain pathogens such as Tropical
Race 4 (TR4) in banana plants; the MidWest Row Crop Collaborative Platform; the Living Soils of the Americas Initiative
to improve soil health and food security; and Better Life
Farming (BLF). Also included are the International Finance
Corporation (IFC, part of the World Bank), Netafim and other
local partners that aim to empower smallholder farmers. We
further describe our stakeholder engagement in agriculture
in the Stakeholder Dialogue section of our Crop Science
Sustainability Progress Report.

On a scale from A+ (best grade) to D–, Bayer was rated B–
by the ESG rating agency ISS ESG in 2024, making it one of
the top 10% of all companies examined in the chemical industry.
CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) has awarded
Bayer the rating of A for its climate strategy. We also
achieved another good result in the areas of water (A) and
forests (B).
We have also produced a detailed report on our political advocacy work, which has been published on our website. In
this process, we have taken account of the expectations of
different stakeholder groups, particularly those of investors.

For more information on dialogue with stakeholders, please
see chapters 3. Product Stewardship, 4. Procurement, 5.
Human Rights, 6. Employees and chapter Focus on: Agriculture as well as our website.
Dialogue with investors and ESG rating agencies
In 2024, we once again engaged in intensive dialogue with
the capital market regarding various sustainability topics.
The focus here was on the topics of climate protection, biodiversity, safe product use particularly with regard to crop
protection, corporate governance and access to medicines
for people in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Through targeted discourse with ESG rating agencies, we
aim to achieve an objective assessment of our company
while also raising potential identified in this way. We were
thus able to improve Bayer’s ESG rating results in 2024.

2.5 Transparency

2.5 Transparency
As our activities concern the sensitive areas of health and
nutrition, they lead to inquiries and the desire to understand
what we do even better. Against this background, we endeavor to strengthen trust further – for which transparent
conduct is essential. For example, we disclose information
from various areas of our work and openly communicate
how the safety of our products is rated.
We supply information about our transparency efforts in the
following areas, for example:
// We make detailed disclosures on, for example, material and project expenses and headcount of the essential political liaison offices in the transparency registers
of the German Parliament, the European institutions
and the US Congress, for instance. We also report
data for countries in which there is no legal disclosure
obligation. For more information, please see chapter
2.2 Compliance and our website.
// As regards tax transparency, we maintain a discourse
with interested stakeholders.
// Through our website, we provide public access to
safety-relevant studies that regulatory authorities use
to approve crop protection product registrations.
We also publish the safety results for our genetically
modified crops on our website.
// Our OpenLabs provide insight into the scientific work
in our laboratories and field trial facilities.
// We publish information on planned and ongoing
clinical trials on the publicly funded clinicaltrials.gov/
website. Trials sponsored by Bayer are published on
our Clinical Trials Explorer website.
// We publish summaries of clinical trial results on our
Clinical Trials Explorer.
// For many years, we have shared patient-based clinical
trial data with qualified researchers. Since 2022, this
has been possible via Vivli, the website of the Center

for Global Clinical Research Data. For more information, please see chapter 3.8 Pharmaceuticals and
Consumer Health.
// In relations between the pharmaceutical industry and
physicians, other healing professions and healthcare
organizations, Bayer ensures compliance with the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and
Associations (EFPIA) Disclosure Code, and, for example, the US Physician Payments Sunshine Act.
// To generate more transparency around our scientific
collaborations, we launched the Bayer Science Collaboration Explorer in Germany in 2021 and expanded
it to the United States in 2022, Switzerland in 2023
and Brazil in 2024. In this publicly accessible database, we disclose information on new contract-based
scientific collaborations with universities, public research institutions and individuals to increase public
confidence in our innovations, scientific processes
and research. The database contains more than
1,300 contracts with partners in 37 countries.
Publications
We strive for maximum transparency in our publications. All
Bayer employees are obliged to properly reflect and disclose
our participation in any scientific work and publications of
third parties and the participation of third parties in the development of our publications. Our Group Regulation on Scientific Publications prohibits ghostwriting and guest authorship and thus meets the strict specifications of important
high-ranking medical journals. For example, all authors must
compile or review essential postings with respect to concept, design and data assessment, and fully disclose all financial relationships, including material support for research,
and other potential conflicts of interest related to the publication.

2.6 Bioethics
New life science technologies are advancing rapidly and offer
the opportunity for a significant positive impact on society,
people and the environment. As a leading company in
healthcare and nutrition, Bayer takes the opportunity to contribute more to this development than almost any other enterprise. However, the speed at which science is advancing
and the possibilities these innovations create, also raise complex ethical questions for us as a research-based company.
With Bayer’s Group Regulation on Bioethical principles, we
have a company-wide, binding and valid ethical framework for
decisions that are relevant in research and development in the
life sciences. The focus is on principles for dealing with medical topics, bioengineering and artificial intelligence, which apply to the following bioethical focus areas:
//
//
//
//
//

Use of genetic engineering
Use of human stem cells
Use of human biological samples
Conducting studies in humans
Use of artificial intelligence in the context
of human healthcare
// Animal welfare

In addition to our sustainability reporting, we have published
further reports that describe topics in detail and are available
to interested stakeholders on our website. These include:

2.7 Cyber Security and Information Protection

Responsible use of human stem cells
We are aware of the particular sensitivity that the topic
of the use of human embryonic stem cells requires.
We pay attention to compliance with legal requirements and our ethical standards.
Our Group Regulation on Bioethical Principles defines
the ethical boundaries within which we use human
stem cells in our research. For example, we only use
human embryonic stem cells in a few selected research projects. These existing cells were obtained in
compliance with applicable laws and approved by the
relevant national authorities.
Bayer is not involved in any research activities that
lead to the production of new embryonic stem cell
lines or to the development of a complete human embryo.
The established principles of the International Society
for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) must be complied with
as the minimum requirement for both research and
clinical implementation; stricter internal guidelines for
specific areas of application are also taken into account.
For more information on the subject of stem cells and
cell therapy, please see our website.

Bioethics Council
As a core element of our approach to bioethics, Bayer has
established the Bayer Bioethics Council, an external advisory body consisting of 11 independent experts. By bringing
in an ethical and societal perspective, it helps Bayer identify
relevant bioethical questions and consults on how to answer

them. The council’s purpose is to support Bayer in further
developing bioethical guidelines for its decision-making.
The Bioethics Council:
// Advises Bayer on how to ensure bioethics is an integral part of our research and development (R&D) work
// Examines our directives from a bioethics perspective
and advises us on shifts in strategy
// Evaluates our progress in implementing bioethics
strategies and guidelines
// Advises on the main drivers behind current bioethics
topics (i.e. technological advances and social change)
relevant to our work
Its members, who convene twice a year, come from five
different continents. Together, they offer expertise in ethics
relating to a variety of academic disciplines in the fields of
agriculture and medicine, ranging from expertise in genetic
engineering and artificial intelligence to philosophy and
sociology. For more information, please see our website.

2.7 Cyber Security and
Information Protection
Bayer is committed to maintaining monitored standards of
data protection and cyber security. Bayer has invested in security technologies and set up defined practices. Bayer is
focusing on the safe management of sensitive information
and defense against cyber threats.
We are committed to protecting our stakeholders' interests
by implementing cyber security measures and safeguarding
sensitive data. Bayer invests in modern security technologies and has put in place cyber security defenses including
ongoing risk assessment, security controls, regular monitoring and IT security awareness campaigns.

Cyber security and information protection framework
Bayer maintains a dedicated cyber security governance
framework. Our Board of Management and associated committees oversee our IT cyber security strategy, which is
aligned with industry best practices and evolving threats.
This strategy is regularly reviewed and updated to adapt to
the changing threat landscape. Bayer has a comprehensive
set of Group regulations on information security and cyber
security, to protect our digital assets and ensure the privacy,
integrity and accessibility of our data. In addition, we have a
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who leads our information and cyber security efforts. Our Cyber Security
Risk Management organization serves as a second line of
defense, carrying out duties related to cyber security, risk
management and oversight. The third line of defense consists of audits. Bayer regularly takes part in cyber security
audits conducted by both external and internal auditors.
This helps us to ensure that our security initiatives and practices stay reliable and adhere to industry norms. Our commitment is underlined by ISO 27001 certification, which has
been attained for some of Bayer’s business operations.
Bayer additionally follows the well-accepted standards of the
US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
Cyber security training
Our employees and contractors receive regular training on
cyber security best practices to enhance their awareness
and reduce the likelihood of human error contributing to security incidents. We regularly conduct mandatory training
courses for relevant stakeholders in several languages. The
completion rate for our fundamental cyber security training
in 2024 was ~97%. To effectively educate and raise awareness among relevant stakeholder groups, a range of media
and approaches are employed.
We have established channels for employees and stakeholders to report violations of laws or regulations and/or internal
Group regulations or processes anonymously and without
fear of retaliation. Bayer maintains an incident response plan

that outlines procedures for identifying, managing and mitigating cyber security incidents, as well as regular risk assessments to identify, prioritize and mitigate potential threats
and vulnerabilities.
Bayer has a contingency plan in place, enabling us to respond swiftly and effectively to unforeseen disruptions, such
as natural disasters or cyber incidents. This plan outlines
clear procedures, roles and resources to ensure minimal
downtime and uninterrupted business continuity during challenging circumstances.

2.8 Emergency and Crisis
Management
We are committed to protecting our employees, facilities,
products, intellectual property and reputation from security
threats, crime, emergencies and crises. In times of emergency or crisis, the safety and security of our employees,
sites and surrounding communities is our highest priority.
Our Emergency and Crisis Management is deeply connected
to our sustainability objectives. Through Group regulations
on emergency planning, emergency response and health,
safety, security and crisis management, as well as pandemic
planning, Bayer has taken action at both global and local
level to prepare the organization for extraordinary events
(e.g. major damage events or crimes) and assess and process them based on standardized criteria.
Our Emergency Management System includes preparedness
and response frameworks, supported by governance and
operational capabilities at both corporate and local levels,
which also includes a Global Security Operation Center
(GSOC) that operates 24/7.
Our Crisis Management System is built in accordance with
the international standard ISO 22361, enabling us to prepare

for, respond to and recover from crises while maintaining
critical operations under challenging conditions. It enhances
Bayer’s resilience through structured management strategies, minimizing the impact of crises on our stakeholders
and operations.
While promoting decentralization and allowing local organizations to respond to crises autonomously, our Crisis Management System ensures that crises affecting Bayer as a
Group are addressed by the Crisis Management Team, led
by a Board member and coordinated by the Chief of Staff.
Our crisis management capabilities are further strengthened
through training and exercises, which help Corporate Crisis
Teams to identify areas for improvement, build confidence
and develop the ability to work as a team under adverse and
stressful conditions.
Our established Business Continuity Management System,
based on international standard ISO 22301, supports our
emergency and crisis management efforts. Business continuity plans outline predefined responses for scenarios such
as personnel shortages, building unavailability, equipment
failures, IT disruptions or supply chain issues. These plans
address various emergencies, including pandemics, prolonged blackouts and climate-related impacts on production
sites. Our management system incorporates IT measures to
safeguard service provision and ensure rapid recovery postdisruption. Plans are regularly updated, and training is provided to ensure effective implementation.
In conclusion, our comprehensive approach to emergency
and crisis management, supported by robust business continuity and risk management systems, ensures that Bayer remains resilient and capable of sustaining its operations and
supporting its communities through any challenges that may
arise.

2.9 Tax
Bayer's Approach to Tax sets out our management approach
and tax strategy. Our so-called “5-C” principle reinforces our
internal tax regulation and is mandatory for all employees to
follow:
// Compliance – We strongly oppose any non-compliance.
// Competitiveness – Tax follows business. We pay taxes
in line with value creation.
// Cooperation – We appropriately cooperate with the tax
authorities.
// Clarity and Certainty – We support self-explanatory
transparency in the right hands and need clear legal
standards to act on.
// Control and Governance – We set up an appropriate tax
control framework to ensure we meet our tax obligations
in a timely fashion.
Bayer observes the principle that we pay the taxes we owe
in every jurisdiction based on the applicable statutory requirements. The contribution of appropriate taxes is a core
element of our corporate social responsibility. In the respective countries in which we do business, the taxes paid by
Bayer represent an important source of revenue for funding
social and economic activities. We comply with the relevant
tax regulations of the countries in which we operate as well
as the requirements relating to the payment, documentation,
disclosure and auditing of our taxes. In addition, we have
implemented appropriate internal controls to mitigate tax
risks. We do not engage in artificial transactions without
substance, we are committed to being transparent and have
a cooperative relationship with all relevant tax authorities.
Bayer’s approach to tax is publicly available on our website
and transparently describes our respective values. The objectives and principles of tax management at Bayer are established in the Group Regulation on Finance. This applies
to the entire Group, and updates are reviewed and approved

by the head of Group Finance and the Group Chief Financial
Officer (CFO).
Responsibility for all taxes and tax effects worldwide in
connection with Bayer’s activities lies with the global leadership team of Taxes, who report to the head of Group Finance. Together, they regularly inform the Bayer CFO about
all important tax matters. The head of Group Finance and/or
the global leadership team of Taxes also regularly report to
the Board of Management and the Audit Committee of the
Supervisory Board.
Observing the applicable regulations and the associated disclosure obligations may include the involvement of external
experts or consultation with the respective tax authorities,
for example. The principles mentioned above also apply
whenever external service providers are commissioned. As
the continuous further development of tax legislation is also
in our interests, we participate in the political discourse while
observing the stipulations of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Lobbying.
Tax risks are accounted for in the Bayer Group’s global risk
management system, responsibility for which lies with the
Board of Management of Bayer AG. As an element of financial reporting, it is also subject to regular review by the external auditor. In this connection, and observing the legal requirements, Bayer separates corporate auditing from tax
consulting so as to rule out conflicts of interest in advance.

Focus on: Agriculture
Challenges and Approaches
Global agriculture and food systems are confronted with major challenges, such as climate change (in terms of both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation), water scarcity and population growth. Scientists and United
Nations (UN) organizations expect the world population to
grow to around 10 billion people by 2050 – an increase of
around two billion people relative to 2024. In addition, both
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United
Nations and the World Resources Institute (WRI) envisage a
50% increase in the demand for food and animal feed by
2050. The demand for animal-based protein and thus also
for animal feed is expected to increase further, especially in
the emerging markets. At the same time, the already limited
farmland is expected to decline due to climate change, water scarcity, soil erosion and other factors. The agricultural
sector therefore needs to meet the demands of a growing
population, while at the same time promoting sustainability
and protecting our ecosystems.
In addition to the challenges already mentioned, it is estimated that around 33–40% of all the food produced for human consumption (including meat from animals fed grain) is
lost or wasted along the value chain including customers.
This means that around 30% of our global agricultural land
is used for food and feed that is never consumed. Besides
food security, this also has a critical dimension for climate
change: it is estimated that food loss and waste account for
approximately 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Solutions from Bayer help farmers to make the best of their
fields and help to increase their productivity on the farm.
This starts with the choice of a seed. For example, high-performing seeds offer improved resistance against common

diseases and pests as well as being adapted to local environmental conditions. This, combined with farm management and pest, disease and weed management supported
by digital decision-making on the field, enables farmers to be
more productive with their operations, thus contributing to
food security.
Optimized seed varieties can also help reduce food loss and
waste in later stages of the value chain. For instance, they
can enhance shelf life, improve fruit firmness to withstand
long-distance transport, or increase the efficiency of processing operations. Furthermore, plant breeding efforts can

focus on developing seeds that cater to consumer preferences, such as convenience and taste, thereby promoting the
consumption of nutritious fruits and vegetables.
Sustainable intensification
Intensive agriculture with high yields per hectare of farmland
is a crucial factor for ensuring the continued availability of
high-quality and affordable food. Agricultural intensification
leads to less land being required for the same amount of agricultural output. While agricultural yields have grown by 60%
over the past 40 years, the amount of agricultural land has
increased by only 7.6%. This productivity increase was

substantially enabled by technological developments in the
areas of plant breeding and – since the 1990s – plant biotechnology as well as by management practices such as fertilization, irrigation and crop protection. Insecticides and fungicides have played a crucial part in reducing harvest losses.
Crops compete with weeds for water, nutrients and light, resulting in a potential crop loss of up to 30%. Herbicides are
an important tool to reduce this growth competition.
Bayer helps farmers cultivate more food for a growing population, improving food security and reducing the environmental impact of farming operations through our sustainability
targets and stewardship. Digital technologies play an important role in this, as do improved seeds and improved agricultural practices. To reduce harvest losses caused by insect
pests, competitors for nutrients or fungal infestation, we
combine our high-performance seeds with the targeted use
of crop protection products. We offer farmers a selection of
these innovative tools and recommend optimal combinations
that enable the use of crop management practices at the
correct time and in the correct place for optimal production.
Regenerative agriculture
We believe agriculture should go beyond sustainable intensification and move toward regenerative agriculture, a key difference being an emphasis on restoring ecosystems while
increasing yields at the same time. We aim to transform agriculture by driving forward a more resilient food system
guided by our vision of regenerative agriculture.
Bayer promotes a concept of regenerative agriculture
(mainly downstream in our value chain) that is defined as an
outcome-based production system aiming to increase food
production, farm incomes and resilience in a changing climate, while restoring nature, especially the health of our
customers’ soil.
Our mission is to transform the agricultural sector at scale
by enabling the adoption of regenerative farming systems to

6. Employees

create a more prosperous and resilient food production system. For us, regenerative agriculture is an outcome-based
production model based on two key building blocks:
productivity, which focuses on helping farmers maintain or
increase yield with fewer inputs for improved social and economic well-being outcomes, and regeneration, which focuses on delivering a positive impact on nature. Positive impacts on nature include improvements to soil health,
reduction in field-level greenhouse gas emissions and an increase in carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change,
preservation and restoration on-farm biodiversity and enhancement of plant genetic diversity, and conservation of
water resources.
Soil coverage, minimization of soil disturbance, a diversification of rotations, an optimization of inputs and a reduction of
their impacts are therefore important practices for achieving
regenerative agriculture.
Our sustainability targets (please see the Sustainability Strategy chapter as well as this chapter below) are important
building blocks on our journey toward regenerative agriculture and comprise:
// Reducing on-field greenhouse gas emissions
// Reducing environmental impact of crop protection
products
// Supporting smallholder farmers
// Improving water use
Currently we are working on developing further building
blocks (e.g. for soil health) and on how to integrate restored
habitats into the approach. Moving forward, we are striving
to take a full systems-based perspective on our approach to
regenerative agriculture and to treat a farm as an ecosystem
in itself – with its unique soil and environmental conditions.
But this also means that a concept of regenerative agriculture must be understood as a flexible framework rather than
a rigid one. Data is the foundation for identifying optimal

Elements of a regenerative agriculture system that are already part of our strategy
Other key aspects of a regenerative agriculture system we are currently working on

We are only at the beginning of our journey toward regenerative agriculture. We also realize there is not one single solution for every farm, but instead a combination of different solutions that deliver a regenerative agriculture system and its
benefits. Some of the innovations and solutions developed
by Bayer have the potential to advance the future of regenerative farming:
// Crops/smart cropping systems (e.g. short-stature corn,
hybrid wheat, direct seeded rice, new cover crops)
// Seeds and traits technologies (e.g. precision plant
breeding, genome editing, biotechnology)

forests. Brazil is the first country in which we are developing
this program, since it holds important environmental assets,
such as the Cerrado, a biodiverse savanna in eastern Brazil
the Amazon rainforest and other habitats. The program has
two pillars:

We see potential in scaling up regenerative practices on
farms around the world providing tailored solutions that
combine our innovation pipeline across seeds & traits,
crop protection and digital farming, and a multitude of
partnerships.

// The first pillar is dedicated to creating new tools that enable forest protection, through which we intend to establish new commercial incentives, improve the implementation of our own objectives and traceability systems and
expand our participation in multi-sectoral coalitions to
build collective action.
// In the second pillar, we aim to create value for existing
forests together with partners who are committed to conserving native vegetation. We have established a research
investment effort to broaden the scientific knowledge of
the interconnection between agriculture and forest conservation.

Initiatives to protect biodiversity
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems.
Forests

Forest habitats are of central importance for biodiversity and
forests play a key role in protecting the climate. With our Position on Deforestation and Forest Degradation we aim to
address the causes of these issues within our sphere of influence, as well as in cooperation with our customers and
within our supply chains. We also aim for net-zero deforestation in our supply chains. In our current response to the
CDP questionnaire, we have included a detailed statement
on this.
In 2023, we launched the Bayer Forest Protection initiative,
which aims to increase our positive impact on the agricultural chain and take a leading role in the conservation of

Agriculture

Land-use change (including fragmentation and degradation
of habitats and intensification of land use) is the main direct
driver of terrestrial biodiversity decline according to IPBES.
We acknowledge that farming is one of the root causes behind this decline, namely because of factors acting at landscape and habitat levels, such as agricultural land expansion
at the expense of natural habitats (land-use change), landscape homogenization (bigger field sizes, fewer structural elements, narrower crop rotations) and land-use intensification
(e.g. increasing mowing frequency and increased nitrogen
fertilization in grasslands).
Agricultural production benefits from ecosystem services
such as pollination, natural pest control and nutrient cycling.
Species that create and maintain these important ecosystem
services are thus essential for food, feed, fuel and textile fiber production. However, agricultural landscapes are not
only habitat to these service-providing species but are also

7. Environment

8. Health and Safety

9. Social Engagement

home to species that may not have direct benefits or may
even damage agricultural production (e.g. pests).
// From a farmer-centric perspective, it is important to maintain and restore the corresponding functional biodiversity
(pollination, natural pest control, soil health) and to reduce the occurrence of organisms that could compromise
the harvest.
// From a biodiversity conservation perspective, it is likewise
important to protect and restore habitats that harbor a
broad range of species in agricultural landscapes.
It is necessary to obtain a better balance between production and conservation. We therefore promote a concept of
regenerative agriculture (for more information, please see
chapter Focus on: Agriculture). We engage in numerous
partnerships and collaborations to further shape the definitions and underlying metrics for enabling a transition toward
regenerative agriculture. In addition, we are members of the
regenerative agriculture program of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) and the Agribusiness Taskforce of the
Sustainable Market Initiative. We also contributed to the regenerative agricultural metrics workstreams that are led by
the World Business Council for Sustainable Development
(WBCSD).
Soil health, habitats and genetic diversity are important aspects that both we and farmers need to consider when striving for a better balance between production and conservation. In the following section, we highlight promising
approaches, actions and partnerships we are pursuing for
each of these aspects.
Soil health

Our main objective in soil health is the development of a soil
health value proposition for key cropping systems. We want
to contribute to solutions for an entire crop rotation system
and not only for one cropping season. Combining our solutions in seeds and traits, crop protection, crop nutrition and

digital agriculture, with corresponding agronomic advice regarding cover crops and tillage, crop residue management
can not only improve farmers’ yield, productivity and profitability, but also lead to beneficial effects on soil health. This in
turn increases yield stability, soil carbon sequestration, resilience to extreme weather events and potentially reduced
costs (inputs, machinery, labor). Through our Bayer Carbon
Programs, farmers can even generate additional income. To
confirm soil health and economic outcomes, we started to
run corresponding long-term trials in selected regions and
cropping systems. For more information, please see our
Crop Science Sustainability Progress Report.

Strategy, please see the Crop Science Sustainability Progress Report.

In a partnership with the Midwest Row Crop Collaborative,
we collaborate with stakeholders to facilitate the adoption of
regenerative farming practices to improve soil health and
long-term productivity in the Midwestern United States –
where some 80% of US corn and soybeans are harvested.

In Europe, we closely collaborate with biodiversity consultancies in the context of our BayDiversity program to facilitate the creation and implementation of biodiversity management plans. So far, 120 farms have participated in the
program.

Habitats

To be able to support impactful measures to counteract biodiversity decline, we continuously invest in research activities
to better understand the root causes of the decline of pollinators and other insects. A dedicated working group at
Bayer is evaluating the factors behind the reduction of diversity and abundance of insects and potential countermeasures. Moreover, we support activities to counteract insect
decline – such as our engagements focusing on milkweed
habitat creation for monarch butterflies in North America,
and our activities with German farmers and conservation institutes enabling ecological enhancement measures to be
implemented in intensive agricultural areas.

From a farmer’s viewpoint, protecting or restoring habitats
can sometimes be seen as a direct trade-off for farming activities unless habitat creation or protection generates some
kind of benefit or provides important ecosystem services to
the farmers.
As part of our Forest Protection Strategy, our PRO Carbono
Commodities Program currently includes soybean production by Brazilian growers and agricultural companies in the
state of Mato Grosso, within the Cerrado and Amazon biomes. As a prerequisite for taking part in this initiative, farmers may not work on agricultural fields that have been converted from natural vegetation in the last 10 years, even if
legally authorized. Additionally, farmers in the program commit to conserving the surplus of natural vegetation on their
properties. In turn, farmers stay on top of innovations and
trends, experience new market opportunities and get publicity for the good practices they already apply. For more information about this program and our Forest Protection

Across North America, Bayer collaborates with conservation
groups, academic experts, farmers and government agencies to protect pollinator habitats. Conserving and enhancing pollinator habitats is beneficial in multiple ways. it can
support multiple other insects, birds and mammals, improve
soil structure and water infiltration and decrease field run-off
to local water bodies. Through our partnerships, we have
supported the creation of more than 171,000 hectares
(423,000 acres) of pollinator habitat since 2015.

future generations. At the same time, we access and incorporate novel genetic variation into our varieties. We support
renowned research centers such as the national gene banks
of the Netherlands (CGN), France (INRAE) and the United
States (USDA) with collection missions and the conservation
of agricultural crops and their wild relatives from different regions of the world before they become extinct from their
natural habitats. This is particularly important for vegetable
crops, where many species are not yet conserved in any
gene bank. Please find more information on our website.
We work with the World Vegetable Center (WorldVeg) in rescuing their unique collection of Brassica crops such as broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower. This collaborative approach
also supports smallholder farmers.
Partnerships and research collaborations

Our collaborative research with ETH Zürich and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in 2021 and 2022
outlined challenges regarding synergies between biodiversity
and agriculture. Insights into the challenges around resultbased payment programs as well as farmers’ perception and
behavior were published in corresponding scientific journals.
In general, the study revealed further need for action and
research. We continue to address these in partnership with
academia, research organizations, consulting companies,
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and others to help
us to become even more effective in our efforts.

Genetic diversity

To gain experience with modern biodiversity monitoring
methodologies and potential new incentive mechanisms for
the biodiversity-friendly agriculture that they enable, we are
part of the EU Horizon Program Biomonitor4CAP.

Conserving crop genetic diversity, helping farmers to access
better crop genetics and breeding crops with higher resilience to the negative consequences of climate change are
our main objectives in this context. By providing in-kind support to public gene banks, we help to ensure the conservation of global collections of agricultural crops for current and

One of the methodologies tested is environmental DNA
(eDNA), which is DNA that has been left in the environment
by organisms, which can be extracted and analyzed to monitor biodiversity or detect the presence of specific species.
Bayer’s focus in the context of BioMonitor4Cap lies in soil

biodiversity and exploring the differences between land
management practices.

more information, please see chapter 3.6 Crop Science –
Research & Development (R&D).

We moreover started a multi-year research partnership with
the University of Trier (Germany) to develop new technologies that advance and optimize the use of eDNA analysis for
field monitoring in the areas of biodiversity assessment and
pest control.

Crop protection products are labeled to inform farmers
about correct usage. To ensure that farmers understand the
label instructions and learn about correct usage, Bayer conducts training for farmers. For detailed information, please
see chapter 3.6 Crop Science.

In Brazil, we are one of the sponsors supporting research to
better understand the relationships between natural vegetation and agricultural production as well as the value of standing forests for farmers in the Amazon and Cerrado regions.

We also support and encourage the development of integrated pest management (IPM) and pollinator management
methods that conserve the abundance and diversity of beneficial insects, protect pollinators and reduce the use of crop
protection products, or replace compounds with less favorable environmental safety profiles with modern, more environmentally friendly solutions. We are therefore conducting
comprehensive field trials under agronomic conditions in various crops around the globe with the objective of deriving
recommendations regarding the best positioning of our
products within an IPM system to protect pollinators and
beneficial insects.

Reduced impact from crop protection products

We understand that crop protection products are often perceived as one of the root causes of biodiversity decline.
However, the available data assessed in a recent metaanalysis we jointly commissioned does not support the claim
that pesticides are a main driver of insect decline.
Potential impacts of crop protection products on the environment are diligently assessed in the development process and additionally by authorities for approval purposes.
Moreover, our researchers work successfully on the discovery of new molecules aimed at further reducing such
unintended and detrimental environmental effects. Environmental safety plays a key role in various stages of our research and development of crop protection products,
starting in early development. We investigate the environmental fate and the effects (ecotoxicology) of the molecule
itself and also of its degradation products in the different
compartments of the environment and for a large variety of
animal and plant species. Data on environmental safety is
also included in regulatory studies. Furthermore, with
CropKey, we use artificial intelligence (AI) in developing
new crop protection products with greater accuracy than
ever before regarding their effect on specific targets. For

With digital tools such as MagicScout and MagicTrap (a digital yellow trap for pest monitoring), we aim for crop protection products to be applied in the right amount and only
when needed, for example through faster identification and
documentation of the causes of damage such as weeds,
pests and diseases.
We are continuing our efforts to further reduce the environmental impact of our crop protection portfolio. Therefore,
we aim to reduce the treated-area-weighted environmental
impact per hectare of Bayer’s global crop protection portfolio by 30% by 2030 against a 2014–2018 average baseline.

Risk mitigation for pollinators and other insects

Insects play a key role in all terrestrial ecosystems, representing a significant part of worldwide biodiversity. One of
the ecosystem services provided by insects is pollination,
which plays an important role in global crop production and
in safeguarding nutrition. To minimize the risks posed to
nontarget insects, including pollinators, by our crop protection products, we perform extensive safety testing and risk
assessments and implement product stewardship measures.
For more information on protecting pollinators and on the effects of our products, please see chapter 3.6 Crop Science.
For more information on measures we have taken with regard to neonicotinoids, please see our separate report.
Advancing digital solutions in agriculture
Bayer approaches digital farming through partnerships and
is building an ag-tech ecosystem striving for greater industry
interoperability to help farmers make the best use of the
breadth of digital farming services and tools on the market,
while applying sustainable practices. Bayer is a partner in
more than 100 technology agreements, and we have made
Climate FieldViewTM available not only to our customers, but
to more than 70 industry partners to provide services, data
models and connected solutions. Our efforts and partnerships include:
// FarmRise (India): a mobile app helping more than
400,000 monthly users access farming advice, evaluate
pest infestations, rent drones, join carbon programs,
check the weather and watch commodity pricing, all from
a smartphone.
// WeGrow (China): a digital platform, social networking
engagement tool, education hub and member reward
program to share agronomic expertise, connect farmers
to service providers and reinforce sustainable practices.
// GeoPotato (Bangladesh): a satellite technology for
a powerful tool for smallholder farmers, as a digital early

fungicides only when and where needed.
// Apollo Agriculture (Kenya): Using aggregated data,
agronomic machine learning, remote sensing and
mobile phones, Apollo delivers financing, insurance, farm
products and advice that can increase farm

Also, through our Better Life Farming Alliance, we aim to
create an ecosystem that equips smallholder farmers with
comprehensive and innovative solutions. It is based on
strong global and local partnerships, aiming to ensure smallholders get access to the knowledge, solutions and technologies they need.

Plant Breeding
Plant breeding (including hybrid crops) plays a key role in reducing in-field losses, achieving improved agricultural yields
and reducing food loss and waste in later steps of the value
chain. Bayer supports the responsible use of different breeding techniques and technologies.
In plant breeding, existing species of a crop (e.g. corn) are
crossed to transfer the desired traits to the next generation
of plants. Our scientists evaluate large volumes of genomic,
phenotypic and environmental data in order to select the
highest performing plants for local farmer environments
around the world. We use greenhouse- and field-based
product testing over multiple years to determine whether the
desired traits have been transferred to the following generations.
Our greenhouse- and field-based product testing and our
scalable data analysis and automation functions provide
additional insight into the special characteristics of our products, such as plants’ ability to resist diseases and adapt
during times of water scarcity. This enables us to give our

farmers tailored recommendations that take account of factors such as the climatic circumstances of a region.
Especially for perishable crops such as fruits and vegetables, plant breeding for a long shelf life is an important factor. Longer shelf lives can improve the tradability of fruit and
vegetables, increase flexibility in the value chain (e.g. to
reach markets further away) and reduce food loss and waste
along the value chain up to the consumer.

PreceonTM Smart Corn System
One example of the possibilities offered by plant
breeding innovations is our PreceonTM Smart Corn
System. This crop system will include digital support
tools and agronomic recommendations to improve the
way corn is grown to make it more sustainable.
Through plant breeding, we have succeeded in developing corn hybrids that enable the growth of shorter
corn plants that have the potential to not bend or
break (agronomists call this root and stalk lodging) as
easily as corn plants of regular height in the presence
of strong winds or heavy rain. Losses in the United
States due to bent (lodged) plants amount to between
5% and 25% a year depending on the severity of
weather events. Due to its short stature, the corn hybrids of the PreceonTM Smart Corn System also allow
farmers in-season access, which enables optimized
application of crop protection products and nutrients
such as nitrogen.

Precision plant breeding
In one of the most transformational shifts in plant breeding
history, our precision breeding platform will drive tailored solutions that reflect the specific needs of our customers’
farms, crops, soils and agronomic practices.

7. Environment

8. Health and Safety

9. Social Engagement

Precision plant breeding uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to guide genetic changes and to access more data
so scientists can quickly and accurately identify the precise
changes needed to remove negative plant traits or emphasize positive ones.
Ultimately, precision plant breeding could result in the delivery of seed varieties tailored to growers’ unique field conditions years ahead of schedule.

Plant Biotechnology
Whereas plant breeding uses the genetic diversity within a
plant species to generate new and unique plant varieties
and hybrids for farmers, plant biotechnology can be employed to transfer genes and their associated beneficial
traits from one organism to another. Genetically modified
crops provide substantial agronomic, economic and ecological benefits. They can help farmers to increase productivity
despite difficult growing conditions by protecting harvests
from specific pests and weeds while consuming fewer natural resources. Farmers in large and small enterprises from industrialized and developing countries alike can benefit from
genetically modified crops, especially corn, soybeans, cotton and oilseed rape/canola. According to information from
the nonprofit organization ISAAA (International Service for
the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications), crops that are
the product of modern biotechnology are grown on more
than 190 million hectares in over 29 countries.
Bayer specializes in high-quality seeds with groundbreaking
traits that offer not just higher yields but also improved weed
control and more effective defense against insects. Our genetically modified plants containing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)
control specific insect pests that feed directly on the plant.
Other insects such as bees and native pollinators are not
harmed by Bt plants. The deployment of these plants can
considerably reduce the use of broad-spectrum insecticides.

Bt corn was introduced in the United States in 1996 and has
since been grown in many countries. According to studies,
growing Bt corn in the United States reduced the usage of
insecticides by 35%, reduced in-field losses by 10% or more
and increased grain quality between 1996 and 2008. In lowand middle-income countries (LMICs), where corn is an important staple crop, Bt corn can improve food safety and
food security.
Crops compete with weeds for water, nutrients and light, resulting in a potential crop loss of up to 30%. Our herbicidetolerant plants are tolerant to certain herbicides such as
glyphosate or dicamba. This enables weeds in fields to be
eliminated using herbicides without damaging the crops.
Using these plants enables farmers to reduce or completely
forgo tillage as a method of weed control. In combination
with good agricultural practices such as the cultivation of
cover crops, no-till has a positive impact on soil health. It reduces erosion in the long term, facilitates the development
of humus and thereby increases storage of carbon in the
soil. This in turn reduces the release of greenhouse gases
from the soil that can contribute to climate change. Furthermore, farmers need less fuel for tillage when there is no
need for plowing and cultivation.
The development and approval of genetically modified
seeds are subject to comprehensive international guidelines
and stringent national laws and regulations. For more information, please see our website. The safety of genetically
modified crops has been confirmed by numerous studies,
which have been evaluated by regulatory authorities in
70 countries. Some believe that genetically modified plants
could spread throughout the environment and thus negatively impact plant biodiversity. However, cross-pollination
between a genetically modified plant and a wild one would
require the plants to be very closely related. Various studies
have demonstrated that the introduction of genetically modified crops has not negatively affected crop biodiversity.

Preserving plants’ integrity
Plant breeding, for cultivation either in conventional or
organic farming, requires measures to preserve the
plants’ integrity and thus to maintain seed quality. To
that effect, the uncontrolled pollination or cross-breeding of plants needs to be prevented. Pollen flow plays
a key role here, both in conventional and genetically
modified plants. For example, in cultivating corn (a
cross-pollinated crop) for seed production, it is essential to be aware of and limit possible pollen flow between adjacent fields. Detailed agricultural practice requirements are in place for our own research sites and
those of our seed producers, to prevent inadvertent
cross-pollination. These rules are spelled out in our
publicly accessible Technology Use Guide for corn,
soybeans, oilseed rape/canola and other row crops.
Among other information, this contains provisions for
planting at a prescribed distance to other fields of the
same crop type or planting at different times to prevent
simultaneous pollination in adjacent fields.
There is no evidence that local or native plants are
adversely impacted in the unlikely event of inadvertent
cross-pollination between genetically modified and
nongenetically modified plants from the same species.
There is also no evidence that plant diversity has decreased because of the introduction of genetically
modified crops. After reviewing more than 900 studies,
the US Academies of Science published a report in
2016 stating that it did not see any indication that the
genetic diversity of major crop varieties in countries
such as the United States had declined due to the introduction of genetically modified varieties. Rather, the
number of crop varieties in cultivation had already declined during the 20th century due to strong demand
for high-yielding crops.

Innovations in plant breeding: genome editing
Bayer employs new breeding methods that contribute to
the development of modern varieties better suited to their
environments.
One targeted plant breeding approach is a molecular biology
process known as genome editing, which is largely based
on improving plants’ characteristics by leveraging their existing genetics, for example by deactivating unfavorable traits
(such as disease vulnerability) or supporting beneficial traits
(such as drought tolerance or improved nutrition). The use of
plant breeding innovations, including CRISPR-Cas, can improve the efficiency and precision of plant breeding and contribute to the development of new crop varieties needed to
sustainably secure the supply of safe and healthy food.
Partnerships supporting access for smallholder
farmers
Facilitating access to the latest techniques and technologies
is essential for scientists to enable higher yielding and
healthy crops amid continued climate challenges. In order to
make these improvements accessible to smallholder farmers, we engage in various collaborations and public–private
partnerships to share knowledge and resources:
// The Modern Breeding Project is a cooperation with the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), providing know-how in technology advancements to plant
breeders so they can increase genetic gain in
local crops grown in countries such as Mali and Nigeria.
// We participate in the International Maize Improvement
Consortium for Africa (IMIC-Africa) to enhance African
farmers’ access to high-quality, affordable, high-yielding
and locally adapted maize seed.
// We participate in the TELA project (previously WaterEfficient Maize for Africa [WEMA]) to improve subSaharan farmers’ yields, food quality and profitability
through improved drought-tolerant hybrids. The Food and

and can be licensed by Bayer.
TR4-resistant varieties of banana

Bananas, a key crop for global food security and the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers, are facing the most
serious threat in decades – the Tropical Race 4 (TR4) strain
of the Fusarium fungus, which has triggered a pandemic on
banana plantations and is devastating the crop harvest
across banana-cultivating regions. At present, control of the
disease using fungicides is impossible. The only way to protect bananas is to prevent the fungus from spreading, which
is extremely difficult, or to develop resistant varieties. Joining
forces with partners from the private and academic sectors,
civil society organizations and state entities within the Global
Alliance Against TR4, Bayer supports the efforts of the Alliance in capacity building for the prevention and control of
TR4 as a model for other diseases that threaten banana production. Our support is focused on prevention and control of
TR4.

The Zero Hunger Private Sector Pledge
In 2022, Bayer signed the Zero Hunger Private Sector
Pledge and committed to contributing US$160 million
to support the goal of combating hunger worldwide, together with other organizations. This pledge was created within the scope of the UN Food Systems Summit.
As part of the Zero Hunger Coalition, we are working to
help end food scarcity in various regions of the world.

Enabling a Climate-Smart
Agriculture
According to a report of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC), agriculture, forestry and other land
use account for about 22% of all greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions worldwide. Climate change places significant
pressures on agriculture in the form of reduced yields, land
degradation and increased threats from pathogens and diseases. At Bayer, we strive to advance a climate-neutral future for agriculture in close collaboration with farmers and
global and local players. This requires the development of
new technologies, digital enablement and the transformation
of agricultural practices. In addition to our commitments to
climate neutrality for our own operations (please see the
Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024), we aim
to enable our farming customers to reduce their on-field
greenhouse gas emissions per mass unit of crop produced
by 30% by 2030 compared to the overall base-year emission
intensity. The overall base-year greenhouse gas intensity includes the weighted emission intensities of 17 crop-country
combinations. In 2024, the crop-country combination

Australia-Cotton was removed from the scope due to the
unavailability of data. Base years are defined individually for
each crop-country combination, using data from either harvest year 2021 or 2022 depending on the availability of data.
Base years were adjusted in 2024 due to additional data requirements based on an updated GHG calculator methodology and lack of data availability from prior years. This reduction target applies to the highest greenhouse gas-emitting
crop systems in the regions Bayer serves with its products
(with the exception of the crop-country combinations ItalyCorn and Spain-Corn that were not selected based on these
factors but were additionally included because data were already available). Our major focus lies on soybeans and corn
in the United States, Brazil and Argentina, paddy rice in India, and wheat, cotton and oilseed rape/canola in various
regions.
Methodology and base-year greenhouse gas intensity
The scope of our efforts is focused on emissions of major
greenhouse gases from field operations: carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2 O). The sources
of greenhouse gas emissions include cultivation, decomposition of applied fertilizers and organic matter, and irrigation.
To measure progress against our target, we use representative samples of Bayer’s customers’ field-level data from a
third-party market research data provider (Kynetec UK Ltd.)
obtained in interviews with randomly selected farmers.
We calculated our overall base-year greenhouse gas intensity based on our customers’ greenhouse gas intensities for
our major crop-country combinations with data from the
2021 and 2022 harvest years. We define our customers according to the following criteria: farmers whose share-ofwallet for our products equals our market share in a particular market at a minimum, farmers using our seed varieties or
our digital platform Climate FieldView™ or farmers participating in our Bayer Carbon Programs.

To calculate the overall base-year greenhouse gas intensity,
individual greenhouse gas intensities per crop and country
were weighted according to Bayer’s footprint in these crops
and regions, estimated using the total production volume of
a particular crop in a particular market as stated in the database of the Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO) of the
United Nations, our market share in this market and carbon
intensity of this crop within a particular country. Using this
methodology, our overall customers’ greenhouse gas intensity weighted across all crop-country combinations in the
scope of our target was 726 kilograms CO2e per metric
tonne of crop produced (base-year greenhouse gas intensity
of our target). We will assess and report our progress against
our base-year greenhouse gas intensity annually or as data
becomes available to support the target we have set.
Base-year greenhouse gas intensities as published in the
2023 Sustainability Report were restated based on the
>10% difference threshold from previous calculations and
due to updated GHG calculator methodology. For more information, please see the methodological report.
Measures
To achieve our target, we foster the adoption of regenerative
agriculture practices and technologies by our farming customers. These include high-yielding crop genetics, crop protection products, precision irrigation systems, soil management tactics through no-till and cover crops, crop rotation,
root health, fertilization management, microorganisms and inoculants, direct seeding and alternate wetting and drying in
rice cultivation, and digital and precision farming tools. Combining different levers can lead to customized and profitable
solutions for our farming customers.
Currently, we are integrating environmental metrics, including a greenhouse gas footprint, into our development field
trials to develop innovative and tailored solutions that combine higher yield with co-benefits such as increased soil
health and reduced water usage.

In addition, Bayer is driving forward the implementation of
regenerative agriculture programs in every region we serve.
Our Global Ecosystem Services support farmers and companies across the value chain to accelerate the adoption of
more regenerative agriculture practices and digital technology. In 2024, we had 22 programs with 18 different companies in six countries globally, with more than 21,000 farmers
participating, and covering more than 1.5 m hectares (3.6 m
acres) where farmers were compensated for the adoption of
regenerative farming practices.

In addition to this program, the PRO Carbono Commodities
initiative was launched in Brazil in 2023 and in Argentina in
2024. It is a solution designed to address the challenges of
the supply chain in moving toward decarbonization, while
also recognizing and connecting with forest preservation efforts. In Argentina, as part of PRO Carbono Commodities,
more than 300 producers who plant over one million hectares of soybeans are having their carbon footprint calculated, and farmers will receive a financial incentive on grain
value from Viterra.

North America
In the United States, since 2020, we have provided farmers
with incentives to adopt innovative, regenerative agricultural
practices through programs such as the Bayer Carbon Program and the ForGround platform. In 2024, we announced
our collaboration with Mars Petcare with the goal of changing
practices on up to 200,000 acres. Additionally, we expanded
our Bayer ForGround program to growers in 28 states with
enrollment possibilities extended to 12 cash crops.

Europe
In Europe, we support the decarbonization of the food value
chain through our Bayer Carbon Program, which was
launched in 2021, and collaborations with other organizations. In 2024, Bayer announced a collaboration with Trinity
Agtech to leverage Trinity Agtech’s platform Sandy, an ag
tech software for measurement and management of regenerative agricultural practices. Also in 2024, we announced an
extension of our collaboration with ADM to drive the further
adoption of regenerative agricultural practices in Europe.

Latin America
As part of our Global Ecosystems Services, farmers who fulfill the requirements, such as social and environmental compliance, and who use our digital farming platform Climate
FieldViewTM are eligible for soil collection and analyses and
have access to technical consultants and professional
agronomists. The PRO Carbono program was launched in
Brazil in 2020 and in Argentina in 2021. In 2024, Bayer,
Louis Dreyfus Company and Global Clean Energy Holdings
partnered to expand the cultivation of camelina as part of
Bayer’s PRO Carbono program in Argentina.

Asia/Pacific
Flooded paddy rice has been identified as a significant contributor to emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
In 2021, Bayer started the India Sustainable Rice project,
which has since evolved into the Good Rice Alliance. As part
of it, Bayer is evaluating the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions as well as water-saving potential in the cultivation
of rice under Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) and Direct
Seeded Rice (DSR) methods. In addition, Bayer is engaged
in developing a holistic rice crop system powered by direct
seeding, and also in 2021, Bayer launched the DirectAcres
project (please see the Conserving Water section later in the
chapter).

Progress
Based on the data collected for harvest years 2022 or 2023
(depending on the base year for the respective crop-country
combination), our overall customers’ greenhouse gas intensity weighted across all crop-country combinations in the
scope of our target was reduced by 9% against the overall
weighted base-year greenhouse gas intensity of 726 kilograms CO2e per metric ton of crop produced. The reduction
was mainly driven by lower greenhouse gas intensity for India-Rice.

Crop Protection Environmental
Impact Reduction (CP EIR)
Crop protection, next to fertilizers and breeding advancements, has helped humanity to feed an ever-growing population while limiting the increase of arable land, which is a vital step in helping minimize land use change. Yet crop
protection products do not just increase yield – they also
have an environmental impact when applied to fields.

The prerequisite for placing crop protection products on the
market is clear proof of efficacy, while ensuring no effects on
human health and only an acceptable impact on the environment. Crop protection products are therefore highly regulated by governmental authorities. Bayer consistently seeks
to develop and offer crop protection products that have the
same or better benefits for farmers, while having less impact
on the environment.
To this end, Bayer adopted a methodology for CP EIR and
set a target for reducing the environmental impact of our
crop protection products. Specifically, we aim to reduce the
treated-area-weighted environmental impact per hectare of
Bayer’s global crop protection portfolio by 30% by 2030
against a 2014–2018 average baseline. For more information, please see the Bayer Crop Science Sustainability
Progress Report and the methodological report. Additional
information will be published on our website.
Scientific models used
The methodology we adopted relies on two leading, externally developed scientific consensus models to enable a
quantifiable environmental impact assessment of crop protection.

// PestLCI has been developed and established by the
Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in cooperation
with other institutes and organizations since 2006. PestLCI estimates the quantity of an active ingredient emitted
into the surrounding environment with the application of a
crop protection product in the field, taking into account
all contributing processes.
// USEtox ® has been developed under the auspices of
UNEP-SETAC in cooperation with various universities
and institutions since 2008. USEtox® determines concentrations in the surrounding environment and the potential impact the crop protection products could have
on the aquatic ecosystems (defined as the potential effect on nontarget aquatic organisms). USEtox ® is also
recommended by the European Commission as a model
for the analysis of products’ life cycles and environmental
footprint.
Bayer provided an extensive inventory of detailed historic
market data on crop protection applications globally to the
DTU. The DTU combined the crop protection inventory
data with PestLCI and USEtox ® to calculate a global crop
protection impact assessment. An external panel of experts is independently performing an assessment of how

Bayer and the DTU apply the models to assess its crop
protection environmental impact, and how Bayer measures
performance against its target and other methodological
considerations.
Bayer’s CP EIR assessment compares the impact of crop
protection products. The calculation results in a numerical
Environmental Impact Score per application scenario. The
score depends mainly on the environmental profile of the
active ingredient applied on the field, the amount applied
and other factors influencing the emissions into the environment such as application method and timing.
The CP EIR assessment does not account for the environmental effects of other tools applied within farming and
integrated crop management, such as plowing, seed bed
preparation, fertilizers or harvesting.
As the science of impact assessment is evolving, we are
working with the scientific consortium developing these
models as well as with other experts in the field to expand
the capabilities of the current models. Currently, we are focusing on the potential impact on aquatic ecosystems, and
we plan to expand the model to soil organisms and pollinators once these enhancements have been published by the

scientific consortium. These models and the underlying
methodology are publicly available.
Scope of the sustainability target
All Bayer crop protection product applications that are
characterizable by PestLCI and USEtox ® and used in the
field globally, as reported in the AgroWin system, are in
the scope of our target to reduce the environmental impact of our global crop protection portfolio. The baseline
for our target is built on an average of all Bayer crop protection products applied in the field globally between 2014
and 2018 and their respective environmental impact. Using an average as the baseline takes account of the specifics of agriculture such as seasonality or dependence on
climatic conditions. To enable the transparency and credibility of the baseline, performance tracking and calculation
of CP EIR, all required model input data is third-party data
– including substance characteristic data. The crop protection application data in AgroWin is predominantly
based on external data providers. To a limited degree, the
data is based on Bayer’s internal estimates.
Outcomes
Applying CP EIR allows Bayer to identify hotspots of environmental impact and develop improvement levers.

8. Health and Safety

9. Social Engagement

Based on the analysis of the environmental impact of crop
protection products, we will be able to recommend a range
of tools to help farmers protect their crops and lessen their
environmental impact. This can help to produce higher-yielding crops with less impact in and around the field.
The levers involved in achieving this commitment can be
categorized as follows:
// Optimization of crop protection volumes required per
hectare through tools such as:
// Precision application: data-driven tools that strive to
ensure the right amount of crop protection product is
applied by farmers in the right place and at the right
time
// Seed treatment: seed-applied crop protection tools
that can significantly reduce the volume of chemicals
used and therefore the potential exposure of wildlife
and the environment to these chemicals
// Seeds and traits: crops bred and designed to better
fight pests and diseases that attack them, ensuring
less chemical crop protection is needed
// Biologics: complementing chemical crop protection
with biologics to enhance integrated management
practices and reduce pest resistance
// Reduction of the environmental impact of the crop protection product itself:
// Better environmental profile of an active ingredient
(lower effect on nontarget plants and species) compared to other products (please see our CropKey approach in chapter 3.6 Crop Science)
// Reduction of the emissions into the environment:
// Mitigation measures such as drift reduction and
buffer strips
// Digitally enabled precision application

2. Corporate Governance

Based on a 2021 data set covering global crop protection use
data, Bayer’s crop protection products represent around 2%
of the global environmental impact of all crop protection products, despite Bayer’s market share in terms of sales being significantly higher (around 15% of the global crop protection
market). For more information, please see our website.
Progress
Based on the data collected between 2019 to 2023, Bayer
has reduced the treated-area-weighted environmental impact per hectare of our global crop protection portfolio by
13% against the 2014–2018 baseline. The reduction was
mainly the result of changes in our crop protection product
portfolio in recent years.

Conserving Water
Scarcity of fresh water affects farmers around the world.
A growing demand for this resource, coupled with climatic
change, is among the factors that have the potential to aggravate the water crisis and put additional pressure on water
availability, water accessibility and water demand. The agricultural sector accounts for nearly 70% of global freshwater
use and therefore has a central role to play in addressing
water challenges – all while continuing to deliver on food
production and striving to ensure global food security. At
Bayer, we recognize the importance of water challenges and
intend to help alleviate the global water crisis.
At the UN Water Conference held in New York in March
2023, we released our water strategy, which aims to have a
transformational impact that goes beyond our own operations and reflects our willingness to contribute to
climate resilience and more sustainable water usage. Our
efforts encompass water dimensions along the value chain,
from our own operations to the farmers we work with. This
is also clearly reflected in our target to support our smallholder customers to increase water productivity by 25% by
2030 against a 2019–2021 average baseline by

transforming rice cropping in the relevant geographies
where Bayer operates, starting in India. Water productivity
is defined as kg of crop yield per volume of water applied
(kg/m 3 ). The baseline validation is still ongoing. Our water
target is currently focusing on the DirectAcres Initiative,
which aims at supporting farmers shift successfully from
transplanted puddled rice to mechanized direct seeded
rice. The water quantification methodology to enable reporting against our target is published on our website.
Direct seeded rice (DSR)
Rice is one of the most important staple foods in the world.
Billions of people rely on a diet that includes rice every day –
but the irrigation of rice crops is responsible for up to 43%
of global freshwater use in irrigation.
Today, a large majority of the world’s rice crop is produced
using is produced using transplanted puddled rice cultivation practices that are especially water- and labor-intensive

and contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions through
higher methane emissions from flooded paddy fields. Traditionally, farmers first grow seedlings in seedbeds or nurseries for two to three weeks before transplanting them in
ploughed paddy fields. These fields are flooded beforehand
with rain, ground or river water. Over the subsequent
months the water level must remain constant to ensure that
the plants establish and grow. Shortly before the harvest (after 90 to 130 days), the farmer drains the field to enable the
grain to mature.
One of the most promising solutions to support sustainable
rice production is direct seeded rice. Direct seeded rice is a
technology-driven and less resource-intensive cultivation
system. Moving from traditional transplanted puddled rice
cultivation to direct seeded rice can help farmers reduce water use by up to 40% and can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 45% (by reducing methane emissions from
the flooded rice fields).

In addition, farmers can reduce their dependence on manual
labor by up to 50%. In many countries, workers are moving
away from rural areas and the agricultural sector. In India, for
example, nearly 60% of the total labor force worked in agriculture in 1991. It is estimated that this number will reduce
to 25% by 2050 at the latest. Many rural agricultural workers
are moving away to urban communities for employment in
different sectors and this transition is leading to uncertainties
in labor availability and higher labor costs for rice farmers.
Using direct seeded rice cultivation methods enables direct
seeding without labor-intensive manual transplanting of the
rice seedlings.

Direct seeded rice cultivation methods could potentially also
contribute to soil health.
Bayer is supporting farmers’ transition to DSR and building
entire systems driven by climate-resilient rice hybrids, a
high-performing crop protection portfolio and digital advisory
and machinery services.
India

India is the focus of Bayer’s approach. Direct seeded rice
has the potential to be transformational, as DSR acreages
are estimated to grow by around 8–10% in terms of the
Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), driven by labor and
water shortages. Some governments of north Indian states
have announced that they will incentivize farmers to switch
to direct seeded rice.
By 2030, Bayer plans to bring the direct seeded rice system
to one million hectares in India, supporting over one million
early-adopter smallholder rice farmers through our DirectAcres
program. Already underway, the DirectAcres program has
seen considerable success, with more than 90% of participating Indian farmers achieving successful plant establishment in 2023.

3.1 Management Approach

3. Product Stewardship
Assuming responsibility for our products, from medicines to
complex solutions for agriculture, is always at the core of
what we do. These should be of the highest quality and contribute to a better life. This means that neither their development and manufacture nor their disposal should cause damage to people and the environment. For this reason, we
conform strictly to regulations and laws all over the world.

3.1 Management Approach
For us, product stewardship means that our products meet
the highest quality standards and are safe for people and
the environment when used properly. Not only the desired
properties of substances and products must be considered,
but also potential effects on people and the environment.
We respect legal requirements, and our voluntary commitment and internal standards go beyond these in a variety of
areas. Bayer has put in place suitable directives and management systems to implement regulatory and voluntary
product stewardship requirements. These are steered by our
Public Affairs, Sustainability & Safety (PASS) Enabling Function and the quality functions of the divisions.
Our quality management systems are based on internationally recognized standards. For more information, please see
chapter 3.6 Crop Science and chapter 3.8 Pharmaceuticals
and Consumer Health. Approximately 75% of business activities (based on energy consumption of environmentally relevant sites) occur at sites certified to standards ISO 9001,
ISO 17025 or ISO 13485.

3.2 Regulatory Conditions
Most of our finished products, such as pharmaceuticals,
crop protection products or some varieties of seeds, are

subject to very stringent regulations prescribing specific and
extensive approval and registration procedures.
PFAS stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. They
are a group of man-made synthetic chemicals used across
industries and products. PFAS are used in a wide range of
industrial and consumer products due to their useful properties. There is no common definition which substances qualify
as PFAS. In recent years, regulatory authorities have prioritized efforts to define what substances qualify as PFAS of
regulatory relevance. There is no currently applicable regulation which restricts any Bayer product. Like all other companies across industries, Bayer is monitoring the evolving regulatory definitions and rules related to PFAS and will continue
to comply with all relevant regulations.
Our products cannot be sold on the market until they have
been approved by a competent authority or an official registration has been granted. As a condition of their approval,
the prescribed efficacy and safety of the individual products
must always be demonstrated as proven. An approval therefore only applies for a particular product with the formulation
entered in the marketing authorization. Changes in the product composition (such as new formulations for crop protection products) require an additional approval or registration.
Where there is no dedicated crop protection legislation in a
given country, Bayer has made a voluntary commitment to
distribute only those crop protection products whose active
ingredients are approved or registered in at least one Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
country or in a country with mature risk-based regulatory
framework to ensure that their safety has been adequately
verified. For more information, please see chapter 3.6 Crop
Science.

Chemical regulations
In addition to regulating finished products, extensive statutory regulations also apply to the chemical substances handled by Bayer during product manufacture. Chemical substances are subject to the respective regional chemical
regulations. These include REACH in the European Union,
the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in the United
States and the Measures for Environmental Management
Registration of New Chemical Substances (MEE Order
No. 12) of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE)
in China. To fulfill these requirements, we have formulated
Group-wide and division-specific regulations.
In addition, authorities in the European Union review the implementation of obligations resulting from chemicals legislation through regular inspections. To meet these obligations,
we require our suppliers to acknowledge conformity with
REACH for all substances they supply to us.
In addition to the regular registration obligation, REACH can
also result in an additional authorization procedure, which
can lead to the replacement or prohibition of the use of substances of very high concern (SVHC). Already registered
substances are also regularly evaluated by the authorities.
For Bayer substances this can result in additional testing requirements, new risk management measures or inclusion in
the REACH authorization procedure. So far, this pertains to
only one Bayer substance, for which authorization has already been granted. The use of SVHCs, including and particularly in research and development at Bayer, is bindingly
regulated by the Group Regulation on Assessment of Chemical Substances.

3.3 Assessments and Testing

Under certain conditions, existing dossiers have to be updated under REACH. In 2019, as part of the voluntary action
plan of the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC),
Bayer also committed to review and update all REACH registration dossiers by 2026. We reviewed and updated 73
dossiers by end of 2024.
The requirements of MEE Order No. 12 in China are similar
to those of REACH in the EU, although MEE No. 12 in China
provides for greater grandfathering of products that are already on the market.
In the United States, all substances must be approved in accordance with the TSCA and accompanied by the information required pursuant to the standard Hazard Communication (29 CFR 1910.1200) of the US Occupational Safety
and Health Administration.
The classification and labeling of chemicals enables users to
become informed about the properties associated with individual chemical substances. Bayer implements the Globally
Harmonized System (GHS) for the classification and labeling
of chemicals worldwide.
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on the handling of substances of concern and
substances of very high concern according to ESRS in E2
Pollution.
Voluntary assessment of substances handled
We voluntarily apply comparable standards around the world,
independent of the respective national legislation. For all handled substances with an annual volume of more than one
metric ton that are not subject to the REACH regulation, we
have voluntarily undertaken to successively provide comparable minimum data sets on ecotoxicology and toxicology. This
data enables the hazard potential of the substances we use in
quantities exceeding one metric ton per year to be assessed.

3.3 Assessments and Testing
Our substances and finished products undergo extensive
assessment and testing to ensure product efficacy and
safety. We examine possible health and environmental effects along the entire value chain and use this to derive appropriate mitigation measures.
The safety of our products is our top priority. As early as the
research and development stage, we assess the properties
of our active ingredients and all other substances that are
contained in a product and could thus impact the properties
of a finished product (e.g. additives that support the actual
active ingredients). We discontinue the development of active ingredients with undesirable properties, applying the
precautionary principle as defined in Principle 15 of the Rio
Declaration of the United Nations and Communication COM
(2000) 1 of the European Commission. However, the focus
should be on a well-balanced evaluation, also considering
potential benefits.
All active ingredients emerging from research are subjected
to further extensive testing and assessments at the development stage that include (legally prescribed) animal studies.
For more information, please see chapter 3.4 Animal Welfare. We also conduct environmental impact assessments or
implement respective mitigation measures for our active ingredients following their registration. Moreover, we help to
raise questions about the impact of active ingredients on the
environment and to have them addressed through sound assessments and analyses.
We carry out these assessments for our substances according to recognized scientific methods such as those described in the Guidance on Information Requirements and
Chemical Safety Assessment of the European Chemicals
Agency (ECHA). Should the analysis reveal potential concerns regarding the intended use of a certain substance, we
take respective measures to mitigate. These can vary from

revised application recommendations to the substitution of a
substance. The substitution of chemicals is basically a continuous task for the chemical and pharmaceutical industry in
generating new or substantially improved products and processes. This is integral to our commitment to Responsible
Care™. The applicable assessment steps are established in
a corresponding Group Regulation.
Strict international and national laws and regulations also
control the official approval and therefore development of
crop varieties and plant traits and the recognition and commercialization of seeds and planting material. This also encompasses genetically modified seeds. We meet all regulatory requirements of the countries in which we distribute our
crops. Extensive and intensive safety reviews of the environmental and health risks for people and animals are conducted
at all stages in the development of genetically modified
crops from early development onward. The results of these
are incorporated into the approval procedures.
Processes are established throughout the company to address inquiries regarding products that are already available
on the market. This feedback is also integrated into our respective product assessment. More information about the
products of the Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health divisions can be found under Pharmacovigilance (please see
chapter 3.8 Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health) and
about the (crop protection) products of the Crop Science Division in chapter 3.6 Crop Science.
Information on substances and products
Bayer compiles safety data sheets for all chemical substances used, even where this goes beyond of what is required by law. Safety data sheets are the central tools of
communication for safety-relevant information about substances and mixtures in the supply chain. Targeting professional users, they contain information on a substance’s
properties and on how to use it safely. In addition, technical
information is provided for professional use.

In accordance with the respective product safety and information obligations, we compile product information for raw
materials, intermediates and end products, and make this
information available across the company worldwide.
Commitment
We are actively engaged in product stewardship activities
through our work in relevant associations and initiatives.
Since 1994, Bayer has supported the Responsible Care™
initiative of the chemical industry and the associated Responsible Care™ Global Charter. We participate in the
further development of scientific impact assessment and are
involved in several associations – such as the European
(CEFIC), US (ACC) and international (ICCA) chemical industry associations and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) – and in initiatives such as
the European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of
Chemicals (ECETOC).

procedures. Potential effects of crop protection products on
the environment and on humans are diligently assessed in
the research and development (R&D) process, starting in
early development, and are also part of regulatory approval
processes. Moreover, our researchers are working on the
discovery of new molecules aimed at mitigating potential unintended effects. Our production processes and synthetic
methods are designed to only produce these products and
to inherently reduce unintended chemical products and
waste. Please see chapter 3.6 Crop Science.
Design for Energy Efficiency: Our production processes are
intended to use energy efficiently. In line with our targets to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we are converting our
sites to 100% renewable electricity by 2029. Please see the
Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024.

Principles of Green Chemistry
Bayer’s approach in the production of our crop protection
products can be compared to the principles of Green
Chemistry as follows.

Use of Renewable Feedstocks: In our production processes,
we make use of chemicals produced by other companies.
The use of chemicals based on renewable feedstock is currently limited to, for example, palm oil derivatives. In many
cases, the quantities of chemicals needed for our processes
are not yet available in the markets. Our procurement
screens the markets and, whenever available, technically
feasible and economically comparable, we assess the use of
chemicals based on renewable feedstock. Please see chapter 4. Procurement.

Prevention; Atom Economy & Solvents and Auxiliaries: Our
production processes for complex chemicals are intended to
reduce inputs and to use solvents and auxiliaries as well as
possible. Also, processes to recycle solvents are used. This
inherently reduces chemical waste. Comprehensive waste
management processes are in place. Please see chapter 7.
Environment.

Design for Degradation: Our crop protection products are
subject to very stringent regulations prescribing specific and
detailed approval and registration procedures. We investigate the fate and effects of the molecule itself and also of its
degradation products in the different compartments of the
environment and for a large variety of animal and plant species. Please see chapter 3.6 Crop Science.

Chemical Syntheses & Designing Chemicals: Our crop protection products are subject to very stringent regulations
prescribing specific and detailed approval and registration

Real-time Analysis & Inherently Safer Chemistry for Accident
Prevention: Our production processes are designed to be as
low-risk as possible. This includes real-time, in-process

monitoring of chemical processes, as part of our management of production processes. We also examine the applicability of principles of inherently safer design and the feasibility of a sound safety concept at a very early stage in the
development of new production processes. High standards
and a comprehensive management system for process and
plant safety are in place and audited regularly by our health,
safety and environmental protection (HSE) audit function.
Please see chapter 8. Health and Safety.

3.4 Animal Welfare
Animal studies are legally required and essential from a scientific viewpoint to assess the safety and efficacy of our
products. We aim to minimize the use of lab animals and to
employ alternative methods whenever possible.
At Bayer, all employees involved in animal testing bear responsibility for animal welfare. Responsibility lies in particular
with the animal welfare officers and the animal welfare committees. The requirements are subject to the laws of the respective country. We respect all legal requirements pertaining to animal welfare, compliance with which is verified both
by regulatory authorities and by means of internal audits. To
ensure that this is the case, clear processes and rules are
defined at Bayer. In addition, Bayer applies its own principles on animal welfare and animal studies, which are specified in Group Regulations. Our principles also explicitly apply
to the contract research organizations (CROs) we commission and to our suppliers, whose compliance with our animal
welfare requirements we regularly review. We monitor compliance with these principles within the Bayer Group and in
external studies.

3.5 Protection against Product Counterfeiting

More than 90% of the animal studies performed by Bayer
and the CROs we commission are in compliance with European standards (Directive 2010/63/EU). These EU standards
are considered to be among the strictest animal welfare regulations in the world and ensure extensive protection for animals. We view it as particularly important that the sizes of
cages housing our study animals meet the legally prescribed
standards or even exceed them. Additionally, for those
CROs we commission to perform animal studies outside of
Europe, we place great value on accreditation to the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care (AAALAC).

September 2024. VICT3R comprises 33 partner organizations from 12 countries and has a budget of approx.
€28 million. During the 42-months duration of the project,
the partners aim to revolutionize toxicology studies by replacing up to 25% of animals used in experiments with Virtual Control Groups (VCGs), setting new standards for ethical research.

In 2024, too, we actively participated in internationally renowned consortia, projects and validation programs geared
toward achieving replacement methods. Bayer currently
sponsors four projects of the United Kingdom's National
Centre for the Replacement, Refinement & Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3R). Bayer led a consortium which
submitted a project proposal on Virtual Control Groups to
the Innovative Health Initiative. The project was positively
evaluated and started its activities under the name of
VICT3R (“Developing and implementing Virtual control
groups to reduce animal use in toxicology research”) in

Through regular inspections, we ensure that both new and
longstanding research partners are regularly audited with
respect to compliance with our animal welfare requirements.
Commitment to reducing animal studies
In early active ingredient screening, Bayer continuously
establishes different computer-based and in-vitro processes
that help reduce the number of animal studies or the impact
on animals in subsequent testing. Included in this are our
activities in connection with organ-on-a-chip, a biochip
method used to investigate the behavior of complete organs
in vitro. In this context, Bayer has since established several
organ systems and platforms that are deployed for both
toxicological and pharmacological issues.

3.5 Protection against Product
Counterfeiting
Product counterfeiting is an enormous problem worldwide,
particularly due to the increase in e-commerce. We endeavor
to resolutely and effectively prevent counterfeiting so as to
ensure that our customers have access to our safe and effective original products, to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights, to reduce potential financial damages
for Bayer and to safeguard the company’s reputation. The
basic principles of our strategic actions against counterfeit or
otherwise illegal products and the corresponding organizational implementation for all divisions are defined in a Group
procedure that complements the Bayer Code of Conduct.
Product counterfeiting can only be addressed internationally
through a joint approach by industry, associations, government agencies and nongovernmental organizations. We

advocate the resolute application and, where necessary, the
tightening and expansion of existing laws and provisions
that serve to enable the identification and confiscation of
illegal products. We support these efforts through extensive
measures of our own in the areas of production and packaging development that are designed to also enable our customers to distinguish original products from counterfeits.
Crop Science
The production, transport, trade and use of counterfeit crop
protection products and illegal seeds are mainly steered by
globally organized criminal networks. Online retail is becoming increasingly important for the distribution of these products. Illegal or counterfeit crop protection products are estimated to account for up to 15% of products sold, while
illegal seeds make up as much as 10% of products sold.
The use of counterfeit crop protection products can lead to a
lack of efficacy or severe damage of the treated crop. Additionally, these products pose a high risk to human health and
the environment (including agriculture and biodiversity) because their contents do not correspond with those of products formulated by Bayer and approved by the regulatory authorities and often contain prohibited active ingredients.
Counterfeit seeds do not possess the traits chosen by farmers upon purchase. The use of counterfeit seeds results in
reduced yields, inferior produce quality or even complete
crop failure, and can considerably affect the income of
smallholder farmers in particular. Illegal seeds increase the
risk that insect pests and diseases will develop resistances.
The use of counterfeit crop protection products and illegal
seeds therefore can also jeopardize the safe and reliable
production of food.

Innovative packaging technology:
SafetySeal and Seal Scan app
It is becoming increasingly difficult for users of crop
protection and seed products to distinguish between
an original and a counterfeit product. Against this
background, Bayer is the first producer of crop protection and seed products to enable farmers to reliably
identify original products through SafetySeal technology. The seal has optical security features and a QR
code that users can scan with the interactive Seal
Scan app to obtain a reliable statement about the
product’s authenticity. The SafetySeal is found on the
packaging of all Bayer bottled crop protection products that are sold in the Europe/Middle East/Africa and
Latin America regions. The SafetySeal was also introduced on the packaging of selected solid crop protection products for the Egyptian and Turkish markets.
Since 2022, the SafetySeal has also been applied to
seed bags for corn and oilseed rape/canola filled in
Europe. In 2023, the use of SafetySeal was expanded
to sunflower seed bags in Europe, and in 2024 introduced on corn seeds in Brazil and the North Latin
America region. Projects to introduce the SafetySeal
on corn seed packaging in Africa as well as on vegetable seed packaging worldwide were also further advanced.

We support association initiatives and work closely with crop
protection and law enforcement authorities to prevent the introduction of counterfeit products to the market by criminal
networks. Our activities in the area of crop protection products are focused on cooperating with the Chinese authorities to identify counterfeit products in the counterfeiter’s production facilities already and seize them before they get
exported from China. In 2024, we identified trademark

infringements, for example in China, India and Brazil, and
successfully asserted our rights.
Globally, we are confronted with an increasing incidence of
illegal or counterfeit seeds. We therefore further expanded
our internal and external action network and our globally coordinated activities to combat illegal practices in the seeds
business in 2024. In close cooperation with local authorities,
we seized significant amounts of illegal seeds, in Brazil for
example, and asserted our rights against the counterfeiters.
Counterfeit products, and especially counterfeit crop protection products, are transported on a large scale by ocean
freight. That’s why Bayer has been cooperating with leading
shipping companies for several years to jointly identify counterfeit and illegal products, prevent their transport and notify the
responsible authorities for further prosecution. In addition,
we participate in a cross-industry alliance with companies
from various sectors.
In cooperation with the United Nations Office on Drugs and
Crime (UNODC) and its Container Control Program (CCP),
and also with the World Customs Organization (WCO), we
offer training measures for customs authorities in the world’s
biggest seaports. These activities are aimed at enabling customs officers to reliably distinguish genuine Bayer products
from counterfeit products based on packaging features and
other criteria and thus detect and confiscate counterfeits
more easily. Bayer supports the work of the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as regards
the issue of the misuse of containerized shipments for illicit
trade.
We conduct our own inspections in the market worldwide
and keep a record of all signs of suspicious and potentially
counterfeit or illegal products.
The use of tested and approved inputs such as seeds, crop
protection products and fertilizer is an essential condition for

sustainable agriculture. Bayer therefore offers training events
for farmers around the world – including smallholder farmers
in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) – on the issue
of product counterfeiting. The training measures convey to
farmers what dangers are harbored by counterfeit seeds and
crop protection products, how to distinguish between genuine Bayer products and counterfeits, and what general
measures protect against the unintended use of counterfeit
products. These training courses are combined with our
stewardship training measures within the scope of sustainable use (please see chapter 3.6 Crop Science).
We also provide our customers with extensive information
on counterfeit and illegal crop protection products and
seeds on our Counterfeits in Agriculture website, including
on how to identify counterfeit products, what risks they are
associated with and how farmers can protect themselves
against unintentional use of counterfeits. For more information on our anti-counterfeit measures, please see the
Crop Science Sustainability Progress Report.
Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health
Counterfeit products that imitate the medicines of our Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health divisions harbor considerable risks for patients and consumers. For this reason,
Bayer has established binding regulations in its uniform
Group-wide quality management system for reporting, registering, investigating and escalating potential pharmaceutical
counterfeiting. Together with the responsible pharmaceutical
regulatory authorities, we initiate the necessary measures
based on investigation results and the severity of each case.
These measures range from notifying business partners and
medical specialist groups to recalling products impacted by
counterfeiting at the appropriate recall level.
In addition to the process established in the quality management system, we have introduced a data management tool
for the corporate security and legal functions. This enables
assessments and reports to be compiled on activities by law

enforcement authorities relating to pharmaceutical counterfeiting that were triggered by information and analyses we
submitted.
Through the Beware of Counterfeits campaign, Bayer is actively addressing the problem of counterfeit pharmaceuticals. The campaign includes a website that provides information on the risks associated with counterfeit
pharmaceuticals and offers tips on how patients can protect
themselves against counterfeiting. The website also provides
information on actual pharmaceutical counterfeiting incidents and explains how patients can distinguish the counterfeit items from our original products.
Safety features for medicinal products

Bayer protects medicinal products worldwide in accordance
with the regulatory and statutory requirements of each country, including those defined by the European Falsified Medicines Directive. This EU Directive 2011/62/EU with its Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/161 specifies requirements and
measures for the inspection and verification of original pharmaceuticals. These include mandatory safety features on
outer packaging, which Bayer has been using for its prescription products since 2019. In 2024, Bayer began preparation activities for extending these requirements to products
for Italy and Greece. These two countries had established
systems with stickers already in place in 2019 for the purpose of counterfeit protection. On this basis, both countries
were subject to a grace period until February 9, 2025, to
comply with the aforementioned regulation. In addition, due
to the United Kingdom leaving the EU and in the context of
the Windsor agreement, Bayer has made preparations to
adapt the products for the United Kingdom including Northern Ireland in compliance with the regulation, which is valid
from January 1, 2025.
Safety features in the EU comprise two elements – an individual serialized and therefore pack-specific 2D data matrix
code and a tamper-evident closure. Featuring individual

serial numbers, the data matrix codes are stored for coding
in country-specific databases across the EU. Wholesalers
and pharmacies can verify the products’ authenticity simply
by scanning the code.
Together with the other stakeholders, we continued working
with the European Medicine Verification Organisation (EMVO)
to create a European Alert Management System (EAMS). An
initial version of the EAMS was activated for use at the beginning of February 2023 and the current slightly improved
version is available since November 2023. The EAMS enables direct communication between all participants connected to the system, thus ensuring simpler and faster analysis of the alarm signals generated in the system to identify
potential product counterfeiting cases. The very low number
of actually confirmed counterfeit products can thus be more
quickly identified, their dispensation stopped, and warnings
issued to protect patients.
It is possible to link existing national alert management systems with EAMS, thus enabling complete pan-European integration. The national alert management systems in Austria,
Belgium, Cyprus, France, Iceland, Germany, Poland and
Slovenia are currently productively connected to the EAMS.
Further national systems such as in Spain and Liechtenstein
are supposed to be connected in the course of 2025. As in
the previous years, also in 2024, Bayer contributed to further developing the EAMS to optimize the effective and efficient use of an improved version of the system that went live
for all users in November 2023. After analyzing and adapting
our processes, the existing alert processing procedure was
transitioned to the EAMS in May 2024 and its benefits leveraged for Bayer and all other market participants. The daily
use of the EAMS revealed needs for further improvements.
Therefore, Bayer is now engaged in the Alert Management
Advisory Group (AMAG) reporting to EMVO and its subgroups on “Alert prevention and reduction” as well as “Alert
escalation and alert closure,” representing the European

Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations
(EFPIA) and its members.
Safety features such as codes with individual serial numbers are also used in many other countries. The graphic
“Serialization and Coding Requirements Worldwide” provides an overview of this. In other countries, such as the
United States, these safety features are implemented for
pharmaceutical manufacturers, and their mandatory use is
being successively expanded to include additional market
participants in the distribution chain. A complete track and
trace system has been implemented in the United States
since November 2023. To ensure that all market participants, especially those along the distribution chain, have
implemented the requirements, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specified a further transition period of
one year, during which no actions will be taken, should all
measures not yet be implemented in the distribution chain.
Bayer punctually introduced and fulfilled all legally specified
regulations and processes in connection with the serialization for pharmaceutical producers. However, because some
stakeholders were not ready even after the additional oneyear transition period, US FDA granted another stakeholder
specific, staggered “exemption” to ensure compliance with
the regulation. Bayer supports and monitors serialization
and coding requirement measures worldwide with the goal
of ensuring standardized protection of patients against
pharmaceutical counterfeiting in as many countries as
possible.
In conjunction with regulatory and statutory requirements
(ISO Standard 21976), we have voluntarily employed tamper-evident closures for nearly all our prescription medicines and also for many of our nonprescription products for
years now to prevent packaging manipulation.
In addition, we deploy a combination of overt and hidden
authentication features that to some extent offer the same
level of security as the features used in bank notes and

identification documents. In this connection, further suppliers of packaging materials into which the security features
are integrated were additionally and specifically qualified in
2024, including in Germany, Hungary and the United
States. This also involves an authorization by the licensor of
the high-security feature deployed. The training for further
packaging material suppliers in Costa Rica, Japan and
Spain began in 2024.
It is important to enable the local supply of counterfeit-proof
packaging materials, in part because this can strengthen
local suppliers, reduce the risk of problems such as losses
in the distribution channel and shorten transport routes.

This in turn allows us to reduce transport-related greenhouse gas emissions while strengthening the resilience of
the supply chain.

Defense against illegal products on the internet
To ensure the safety of patients and customers and
protect our products, we are actively fighting against illegal pharmaceutical product offerings on the internet,
such as on marketplaces and social media channels.
In 2024, we engaged our own service provider and

extended the scope to 10 of our products that are
most exposed and at risk of being falsified. In 2024,
we succeeded in shutting down about 1,700 illegal
websites and impermissible offers worldwide on marketplaces such as eBay or on the dark web and on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Telegram. Of a total of 3,815 alerts with
takedown requests, about 200 targets were no longer
active, about 900 takedowns were denied and about
750 takedown requests are still a work in progress.
Together with other members of the EFPIA and
through the European Alliance for Access to Safe
Medicines (EAASM), we advocate for a comprehensive
change in the legal foundations of and obligations on
internet players. Of outstanding importance was the
amendment to the Digital Service Act (DSA), which
was adopted by the European Parliament in July 2022.
The provisions of the DSA highlight possible approaches for further improvement and added security
in online retailing that we have identified together with
other impacted parties via the EAASM, the Alliance for
Safe Online Pharmacy (ASOP EU) and the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO).
We also support the “Memorandum of Understanding
(MoU) on the sale of counterfeit goods on the Internet”
initiated by the European Commission.
For many years now, we have served on the Executive
Board of the EAASM so as to educate patients about
the dangers of purchasing drug products on the internet. We provide information on the associated risks
and consequences through information campaigns, research projects and publications.

Since 2022, Bayer has been a member of TAPA EMEA, the
European branch of the Transported Asset Protection Association (TAPA), to further increase the resilience of our distribution chain as regards additional risks posed by theft and
misappropriation. This gives us access to specific analyses
of identified dangers and risks in the distribution chain and
during transport, enabling us to examine the potential of
possible defense mechanisms for implementation and their
usability in our distribution chain. Consequently, we have introduced new Group regulations for the reporting of supply
chain related incidents as well as defined the corresponding
roles and responsibilities in the supply chain to ensure unified standards across the globe.

3.6 Crop Science
Before crop protection products and technologies can be introduced to the market, it must be demonstrated that their
label-compliant use is without harm for humans and does
not expose the environment to an unjustifiable risk. They
therefore require official approval, which is governed by numerous international and national laws and regulations. We
test products in compliance with the applicable official regulations and perform extensive risk assessments. We also
comply with import regulations for importing countries and
obtain product approvals in countries in which the products
are to be marketed.
Management approach
Responsibility for product stewardship in Bayer’s Crop Science Division lies with the divisional function of Research &
Development, which reports directly to Bayer’s Crop Science
Executive Leadership Team (ELT), the highest decision-making body within the division. The ELT is led by the head of
Bayer’s Crop Science Division, whose position makes him
a member of the Board of Management of Bayer AG.
We work continuously to improve our products and develop
solutions for more sustainable agricultural practices. The

focus is on optimizing product benefits, including safety for
people and the environment, and applying the findings from
product monitoring. For us, product stewardship is a life cycle approach that begins at the research and development
stage of a new product, continues through its production,
marketing and safe use, and ends with the final disposal of
any waste.
We have specified our principles of responsible product
management in our Group Regulation on Product Stewardship Commitment, Principles and Key Requirements. This is
based on established and internationally recognized standards such as the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide
Management issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO), the guidelines of the crop protection association CropLife International, and the guidelines of the
industry initiative Excellence Through Stewardship (ETS) for
seeds and plant traits. This initiative promotes, for example,
the introduction of product stewardship programs and quality management systems for seeds throughout the entire life
cycle and entrusts independent outside experts with the
performing of audits to verify that member companies are
complying with its guidelines. Our plant biotechnology sites
across the Asia region and in Australia were recertified for
the product stewardship programs in 2024.
For more information on our target for smallholder farmers in
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), please see the
Sustainability Strategy chapter.

Online transparency platform
Transparency is very important to Bayer, especially
with respect to the safety of our products. Through
transparency, we aim to strengthen our customers’
and stakeholders’ confidence in our products. Bayer

was the first company in the agriculture industry to
make safety-relevant data on crop protection products
and genetically modified crops accessible. Summaries
of scientific studies assessed by the European Food
Safety Authority (EFSA) in connection with the registration procedures for 30 of our crop protection active ingredients are available on our online transparency platform, including toxicological and ecotoxicological
studies and investigations into degradability. There, we
have also published summaries of scientific studies for
16 biotechnology traits within our seeds business that
were previously evaluated by the responsible regulatory authorities in the United States. Comprehensive
reports on the registration studies for the approval of
our crop protection products and genetically modified
crops are available on specific request.
In addition, we actively address public concerns and
provide clear, comprehensive information on critical
agriculture-related safety topics in the news. For example, we facilitate access to information such as the
emergency authorization processes, our comprehensive product stewardship and risk mitigation measures
to support the safe use of neonicotinoid products. We
articulate how glyphosate allows farmers to control
weeds effectively and help secure the livelihood of the
farmers and the food supply chain, as well as its rigorous and extensive safety testing and oversight by regulatory agencies worldwide. We also explain why it is
so important that farmers in the EU continue to have
access to flupyradifurone, a modern insecticide for foliar, drench, drip and seed treatment application. Additionally, we provide our detailed response to the allegation that we have withheld developmental
neurotoxicity studies from the EU regulatory process
and our globally applied, stewarded approach to managing highly hazardous pesticides (HHPs).

3.6 Crop Science

As part of the testing process, chemical and biological crop
protection products are examined early in the development
phase with regard to their mode of action, their (eco)toxicological properties and the extent of potential residues in
plants and the environment to ensure that we only continue
to develop those products with the best safety profile. It
usually takes 12 to 14 years to develop a new active ingredient for crop protection products.

We have specified internal processes in a Group Regulation
to ensure a responsible approach to biotech-based manufactured products throughout their entire life cycle. For more
information on plant breeding and genetically modified
seeds, please see chapter Focus on: Agriculture.

CropKey – using artificial intelligence (AI) in R&D
to design new crop protection

Development and in-licensing projects for crop protection
products whose acute toxicity is classified as WHO class 1a
or 1b, are not pursued. We market only those crop protection products whose active ingredients are registered in at
least one OECD country or a country with a mature riskbased regulatory framework. For crop protection products
that do not meet that criteria, further activities and risk assessments are performed. This enables selection and implementation of the right projects in a sustainable manner and
makes the best use of available resources in research and
development.

CropKey, our novel and innovative approach to crop
protection chemistry relies on breakthrough technology – such as computational target and profile driven
discovery – to design entirely new, sustainable crop
protection solutions. Our ambition is to unlock new
ways to protect our crops, going above and beyond
current standards, and to potentially further reduce
the impact of crop protection on the environment
substantially.

Each R&D project must undergo a thorough safety assessment as defined by the respective regional and country regulatory environments, following a risk-based approach that
often exceeds these country requirements – particularly in
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This risk-based
approach takes account of local agronomic use conditions
in LMICs, especially common local application techniques
that are not widespread in Europe or the United States (e.g.
manual application of crop protection products or on-farm
seed treatment). For these scenarios, we have developed
relevant exposure models globally that consider actual use
conditions. They are consistently applied before triggering
development work for new products. R&D projects that we
do not consider safe under the current use conditions are
not pursued further. The development of genetically modified
seeds is also subject to extensive international guidelines
and stringent national laws and regulations.

CropKey is supported first by a Target Based Discovery process. It consists of identifying in each biological
pathway, the right target, or protein that can be
thought as a “lock” and that is unique to the pest species. With more scientific understanding than ever before about the makeup of living organisms and their
complex biological processes in any given environment, using AI and machine learning we can identify
the complex interdependencies between a theoretically unlimited number of organisms, singling out
unique proteins (rather like locks are unique) far faster
and with greater accuracy than ever before. Using
computational predictive modelling, we design the
crop protection molecule according to predefined
safety and sustainability profiles that will inhibit the
identified target protein – a second process called
Profile Driven Discovery. The molecule designed can

be thought of as a precise “key” for the unique lock.
The uniqueness of the lock in a given pest organism
and the precision of the key means that other nontarget species are protected.

Environmental safety

We take aspects of environmental safety into account very
early on in the process of designing a new active molecule
for a crop protection product. This includes the design of
active molecules that can degrade in the environment and
with no unacceptable effects on environmental nontarget organisms in the spirit of “safe by design.” Therefore, our 600
specialized researchers globally conduct experiments in
vitro, in vivo, in the lab and in the field. Our studies are conducted according to internationally agreed test guidelines
(e.g. OECD) and under Good Laboratory Practices (GLP),
which ensures the best possible study quality, reliability,
documentation and traceability. We also use scientific literature, biomonitoring data and computer models.
We investigate the fate and effects of the molecule itself and
also of its degradation products in the different compartments of the environment and for a large variety of animal
and plant species. Combining the results from effect and exposure level testing, we can quantify the environmental risk.
// Testing of side effects on the environment (ecotoxicology): Toxicity to different species is tested – usually we
look at up to 60 species from different trophic levels and
taxonomic groups that are sensitive to chemicals, widespread and representative of the biology and ecology of
other species. To protect them, we investigate effects of
our technologies on their survival, development, growth,
behavior and reproduction.

In many countries, the safety of our products is re-evaluated
by authorities (e.g. every 10 to 15 years in the EU) in view of
the latest status of science and regulations. This allows us to
progressively withdraw old chemicals from the market and
replace them with new products with an improved safety profile. For crop protection products over the past years (2020–
2023), we conducted more than 1,600 studies on ecotoxicology and around 270 studies on environmental fate.

// Exposure testing (environmental fate): Laboratory and
field experiments as well as model calculations and monitoring programs are used to investigate and understand
the distribution of substances between the different environmental compartments (soil, groundwater, surface water, air and sediments), how and how fast they degrade
and which metabolites they form. Identified metabolites
are investigated in the same way to understand their environmental fate, too.

Using this scientific data, we evaluate the risks of the product, and we define the conditions under which the products
can be used safely. These conditions are written on the
product label, which are the instructions a grower needs to
follow when using our products. The product will cause no
unacceptable harm to the environment (as defined by the
specific protection goals set by the regulators) if it is used
according to this label. We support farmers worldwide in the
professional handling of our products. For more information
about this, please see our website.
Around the world, regulatory authorities systematically check
our data, risk assessments and labels, and perform their
own risk evaluation before they authorize (or do not authorize) a product to be launched on the market. In the EU, a
typical dossier for the registration of a new active molecule
consists of 130 studies on ecotoxicology and 20 studies on
environmental fate.

We apply the evaluation criteria of our Bayer Crop Protection
Safety Standards as well as stewardship measures to ensure
that our crop protection products are safe when used according to label instructions.
Since 2021, we have shared our crop protection operator
safety standards on our website. These voluntary standards
reflect the guidelines and standards of international organizations such as the FAO of the United Nations, the WHO
and the OECD, as well as those of reference regulatory authorities around the world. These safety standards use information on the toxicological profile of the active ingredients
and crop protection products and their behavior during and
after use. They evolve continuously based on the latest scientific knowledge, and we invite internationally respected researchers from academia and other expert groups to review
them.
The operator safety standards and the associated data acquisition exceed local regulations in many countries. Here,
we particularly consider specific use and application scenarios that are mostly relevant in LMICs. In 2021, an expert review panel was held with external scientists.
Studies and regulatory approval

Our BASE (Bayer Societal Engagement) principles set out
the principles of Good Scientific Practice, especially in relation to the transparency of studies conducted including publication and collaboration.

3.6 Crop Science

Before a crop protection product is approved for use on the
market, safety studies must be conducted in accordance
with scientific principles and quality standards mandated by
regulatory agencies to safeguard the health of people, animals and the environment. Usually, more than 150 different
studies are required to evaluate and demonstrate the safety
of a crop protection product.

to engage with visitors and answer their questions live.
In addition, we continue to grow the OpenLabs 360o
platform by expanding it to include how the safety of
genetically modified crops is assessed at Bayer.

Approved products

These studies are conducted using the services of renowned
and accredited service providers that work according to
GLP and follow internationally approved guidelines. GLP are
principles outlining how safety studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived to
maintain the quality and integrity of study data that supports
regulated products.
Sponsorship is disclosed on the cover page of the study reports that are part of the regulatory dossier submitted to authorities. Regulatory authorities conduct independent audits
on companies’ processes, test facilities and studies to confirm compliance with GLP standards.

OpenLabs
Through the OpenLabs program initiated in 2020, we
offered the public the opportunity to visit our site in
Monheim, Germany, to observe our scientists as they
carry out a safety study. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we replaced the Monheim onsite visitor program with a new virtual visitor platform, Bayer
OpenLabs 360°, which allows visitors to observe how
we collect data on the safety of our crop protection
products by complying with guidelines and with GLP
at any time and from anywhere in the world. Since its
launch in 2022, the Bayer OpenLabs 360o platform
and related online events have enabled our scientists

In general, operator safety, consumer safety and environmental safety studies have to be submitted if crop protection
products are subject to reapproval or reregistration across
the globe. However, not all countries’ regulatory systems apply sufficiently stringent risk assessment in our opinion.
For that reason, we have undertaken on our own accord to
successively screen uses beyond the legal requirements
against our own high voluntary standards of user safety. We
began a systematic evaluation in 2020.
In a stepwise approach, we started with substances that
have lower toxicological thresholds and high sales volumes.
This screening includes checks on operator safety of use
under actual, local working and agronomic conditions. We
also check the label instructions for safe use of the crop
protection products to ensure compliance with our safety
standards. For more information on our approach to the development and use of crop protection products, please refer
to our Product Development Report.
Production, packaging, storage and transport
Health, safety, environmental protection and quality are a top
priority for Bayer at all its sites around the world, including the
sites where crop protection products or seeds are produced.
A health, safety and environmental protection (HSE) management system with uniform standards applies Groupwide. For more information, please see chapter 7. Environment. Product manufacture at our sites is performed according to the quality management standard ISO 9001. As
with our suppliers, we expect our third-party producers to

conduct their business with Bayer in accordance with the requirements of our Supplier Code of Conduct. For more information, please see chapter 4. Procurement.
Labeling and packaging

To allow safe use, crop protection products must be labeled.
The FAO Guidance on Good Labelling Practices for Pesticides (FAO Guidance) and the underlying Globally Harmonized System (GHS) for classification and labeling of chemicals are the relevant and acknowledged international
standards.
At Bayer, overarching and uniform requirements regarding
labeling and packaging of crop protection products are
included in our Group Regulation on Product Stewardship
Commitment, Principles and Key Requirements, among
other regulations. Our product labels follow the FAO Guidance and the GHS and also comply with local regulatory
requirements for classification and labeling. In countries
where there are no specific requirements for labeling, our
crop protection products are classified and labeled in accordance with the FAO Guidance and the GHS. When local
regulations deviate from the FAO Guidance and the GHS, we
use this reference to advocate for label improvements whenever possible.
Packaging materials used for crop protection products are
certified according to UN Transport of Dangerous Goods
Model Regulations. These refer to the mechanical stability of
the packaging as well as the compatibility of the packaging
material with the contained chemicals. Packaging is registered in the countries of sale according to the locally required
regulations.
We also ensure that our products are stored and transported according to the applicable legal and regulatory requirements. For more information, please see chapter 8.

Marketing, sale and distribution
Our Code of Conduct establishes how we interact worldwide with various stakeholders.
Marketing and sales

We are committed to ethical marketing and sales practices
that meet the standards set by external regulations and
codes of practices, in particular the laws and regulations
dealing with advertising and marketing practices, the applicable global, regional and local industry codes relevant for
our business as well as data protection and the privacy of
customer or consumer information.
The Group Regulation on Integrity & Responsibility in Communications and Marketing holds our employees, contractors and agencies accountable for ensuring that communications and marketing activities and materials are compliant,
appropriate, honest, fair and respectful.
In line with our Group Regulation on Product Stewardship
Commitment, Principles and Key Requirements, which is
based on the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide
Management issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the WHO, we adhere to
ethical marketing and sales practices that meet applicable
regulations. Our Group Regulation on Stewardship and
Compliance Incident Management ensures the management
and investigation of external complaints.
Distribution

In its distribution of crop protection products and technologies, Bayer follows the International Code of Conduct on
Pesticide Management of the FAO of the United Nations and
the WHO. Our principles are defined in our Group Regulation
on Product Stewardship Commitment, Principles and Key
Requirements.

Self-commitment

Our crop protection products are classified according to
their WHO acute toxicity class, and this classification is
maintained in our internal database. Internal processes ensure that no new product with a WHO class 1a or 1b category can be marketed. In addition, since 2012, we have no
longer sold WHO Class 1a or 1b agricultural crop protection
products, despite continued formal authorization to do so.
We also withdrew registrations on WHO Class 1a or 1b agricultural crop protection products.
Not all of our crop protection products are registered in Europe. There are various reasons for this, e.g. different customer needs and agricultural practices outside Europe.
These crop protection products are registered in accordance
with national regulations outside Europe. Bayer complies
with international regulations, e.g. the UN Rotterdam Convention concerning the export of such products that could
be produced in Europe but are not registered in Europe, being registered instead in the importing country. We market
only those crop protection products whose active ingredients are registered in at least one OECD country or a country with a mature risk-based regulatory framework.
We regularly review the products we offer in emerging markets and developing countries with respect to the applicable
specifications for ensuring the safety of our products and
reducing the risks associated with their use. We voluntarily
withdraw such products from the market if identified risks
cannot be limited sufficiently. For more information on the
safety of crop protection products, please see our website.
To ensure the safe use of our crop protection products
based on adequate research, we made an important voluntary commitment – we market only those crop protection
products whose active ingredients registered in at least one
OECD country or a country with a mature risk-based regulatory framework. OECD data packages require the preparation of complete dossiers for crop protection products and

their active ingredients in support of regulatory decisions in
OECD countries. They include the findings of all test and
study reports and other relevant information submitted by
the company and other interested parties. This data needs
to be made available to facilitate checking by regulatory authorities as a basis for decision-making with respect to the
approval of individual active ingredients, the registration of
crop protection products, the establishment of a maximum
residue limit, or the determination of an import tolerance, as
appropriate. The guidance contained in the OECD package
can be used by regulatory authorities, where the evaluation
of extensive data submissions is necessary.
For the marketing of genetically modified seeds, we have
established internal processes and defined the requirements
for the responsible use of biotechnology in our Group Regulation on Product Stewardship Commitment, Principles and
Key Requirements.
Counterfeit products

Counterfeit products harbor substantial risks for users and
the environment. For more information on our strategy for
preventing product piracy, please see chapter 3.5 Protection
against Product Counterfeiting.
Integrated weed management
Bayer offers farmers sustainable integrated weed management (IWM) programs to help guide them through sciencebased, best practices for crop protection and herbicide
stewardship. These customized solutions show farmers the
benefits of a holistic approach to weed management, for example by using crop rotation, planting cover crops or utilizing multiple modes of action or other cultivation practices.
IWM is a systematic approach for long-term weed management and is particularly useful for managing and minimizing
herbicide resistance. Thus, incorporating a combination of
weed management measures helps to sustain weed control
systems over time and maintain farms’ ability to provide

productive harvests while protecting the soil by helping to
reduce soil erosion and increasing soil organic matter levels.

Bayer ForwardFarming
Bayer ForwardFarming promotes regenerative agriculture by fostering dialogue and showcasing on-farm
practices with independent farmers. Together with
farmers and scientific experts, we are improving and
pioneering agronomic practices with a strong focus on
improving soil health, biodiversity conservation, environmental impact reduction, carbon-neutral agriculture
and water conservation, for example.
On ForwardFarms, we share how end-to-end stewardship solutions, including integrated crop management and resistance management, can be put into
practice. In this context, ForwardFarmers demonstrate modern cultivation techniques and the sustainable and safe use of seeds and crop protection products, as well as managing resources responsibly.
We aim to inspire a greater number of farmers to
adopt regenerative agricultural systems that produce
more with less while restoring nature. Via the worldwide ForwardFarming network we promote dialogue
and the exchange of ideas and findings among a wide
range of stakeholder groups via in person-visits.
The global network currently includes 24 ForwardFarms spread across Europe (12), Latin America (7)
and Asia (5). In 2024, a network of 12 independent
farms in Argentina and Uruguay was established under
the ForwardFarming Scale-Up Model framework.
These farmers share their agricultural practices and
advocate the adoption of regenerative agriculture
within their communities.

Responsible use of crop protection products
Bayer’s consistent safety standard aims that our crop protection products are safe for humans (from operators to
consumers) and cause no undue harm to the environment if
used according to label instructions. Aside from our high
safety standards for the crop protection products we sell,
we conduct a wide range of product stewardship activities
that align with the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management issued by the FAO of the United Nations.
Training

Through targeted training courses, we show farmers, seed
treatment professionals, distributors and other users how
to use our products both effectively and safely to maintain
healthy plants and thereby increase the yield and quality of
their harvested goods. Our objective is to continuously increase the outreach of our training activities through more
widespread use of digital media.
The training courses cover aspects such as the safe handling of our products during use, transport, storage and disposal, the correct use of protective clothing and equipment,
and first aid measures in the event of emergencies. The
training topics can be adapted for specific target groups, a
particular crop being used in cultivation or a particular product, according to local requirements. Our training materials
are available in various formats – from on-site presentations
to brochures, videos, posters, manuals and live chats. In addition to special training measures for farmers and those
who use crop protection products, we also combine training
activities with events such as product launches or field days
to reach a large number of farmers and distributors. Our
training videos on the safe handling of crop protection products are also available online.
In 2024, we continued to offer virtual training activities that
we had widely introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic,
but also resumed on-site training wherever possible. The
flexible approach and use of digital tools enabled us to

reach almost 5.4 million external contacts worldwide (e.g.
farmers, field workers, distributors, retailers and other
stakeholders in the agriculture industry), including around
4.1 million smallholder farmers. We focused many of our
training activities in countries where there is no legal requirement for farmers to be certified in the safe handling of
crop protection products. Most of the people we trained
were in Asia, followed by Africa and Latin America. Our
partnerships enable us to increase the reach of the activities and conduct joint events, for example with universities,
information centers or local, regional and international associations.
Bayer also trains farmers in various technical areas in the
correct use of individual products. This includes training as
mandated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
as a condition of registration for products containing the
herbicide dicamba for use in dicamba-tolerant soybean and
cotton crops. This training course was developed in cooperation with other dicamba herbicide registrants and governmental certification authorities. Successful completion of the
training helps enable farmers to apply low-volatility dicamba
products for use in dicamba-tolerant soybean and cotton
crops. Approximately 19,600 users in the United States
completed this certification in 2024, 72% of whom were
trained by Bayer.
Additionally, Bayer trains internal staff on the responsible use
of pesticides used at our sites that support product research
and development, plant breeding and seed production. In
North America this training has been formalized as part of
our internal pesticide management programs (Responsible
Use @ Bayer) to enhance pesticide knowledge and is leveraged to increase Bayer’s understanding of how to improve
overall pesticide safety training for our products.
Bayer Safe Use Ambassadors

Besides training farmers, we are also engaged in training agricultural students and physicians in LMICs through our

Bayer Safe Use Ambassador initiative. Our goal is to advance farmers' safety and reduce the environmental impact
of crop protection products through knowledge transfer and
empowerment.
Since 2017, through the initiative, we have partnered with
more than 50 universities across Asia/Pacific and Africa. In
collaboration with agricultural universities, we offer students
training in the safe use of crop protection products, prioritizing safety for both users and the environment. These students then become safe use ambassadors and transfer their
knowledge to farmers during internships. During 2024, more
than 1,400 students were trained on the sustainable use of
crop protection products.
In the medical sector, we provide physicians and poison
control centers with guidance about the hazards, toxicity
and treatment of crop protection product poisoning as well
as the treatment of snake bites. In 2024, the program continued to connect the medical sector in East Africa, fostering
exchange and building knowledge among healthcare professionals. More than 1,000 medical professionals and Bayer
employees participated in the latest medical webinar series,
“One Health: Pesticide Toxicology & Management of Poisoning,” where they learned about prevention, treatment and
safety in the field.

Product stewardship for glyphosate
The nonselective herbicide glyphosate is used in many
countries for effective, simple and cost-effective weed
control. The active ingredient was first introduced in
1974 and has since been marketed under a number of
different tradenames in hundreds of crop protection
products by several dozen different companies worldwide. In Europe, glyphosate-based herbicides are
most frequently used, according to the label, to

control weeds in various field crops. According to the
label, applications also include weed control in noncultivated areas, such as in industrial complexes and
along railway tracks. Glyphosate works in plants by
specifically inhibiting an enzyme that is essential to
plant growth. This enzyme is not found in the cells of
humans or animals.
Glyphosate use enables conservation tillage, which
brings its own benefits in terms of reduced soil erosion, improved water retention in soil and lower carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. In agricultural systems
where glyphosate-tolerant crops are not available,
glyphosate provides benefits for farmers and the environment by simplifying weed management, reducing
the need for mechanical tillage and enabling the
adoption of cover crops. Outside of agriculture,
glyphosate delivers benefits for noxious or invasive
weed control.
Glyphosate has a proven track record of 50 years of
safe use when used according to label directions. This
is confirmed by science-based evaluations conducted
by European regulatory bodies such as the European
Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals
Agency (ECHA) and the German Federal Institute for
Risk Assessment (BfR), and other leading regulatory
authorities such as the EPA and the Canadian governmental authority for pest control belonging to the Department of Health (Health Canada Pest Management
Regulatory Agency [PMRA]). The most extensive agricultural epidemiological study ever with detailed information on glyphosate use, the Agricultural Health
Study published in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute in 2018, also found no association between
the use of glyphosate-based herbicides and the occurrence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The study followed

more than 50,000 licensed applicators of crop protection products for more than 20 years.
Glyphosate’s environmental safety profile underlies its
ability to be used in many diverse settings. Detailed
reviews by the EFSA, PMRA and other regulatory
authorities have concluded that approved uses of
glyphosate-based herbicides are unlikely to cause adverse effects on the environment. In the United States,
EPA scientists reached the same conclusion following
their primary environmental review and have initiated
a final step in the re-registration process to ensure
current uses account for potential effects on endangered species. This is a standard review for all crop
protection products in the United States and can take
several years to complete. Bayer scientists reviewed
the draft report on endangered species and engaged
in the public comment period.
Extensive information on the public discussion surrounding the safety of glyphosate for users and the
environment is available on our website. For information
on the lawsuits against Bayer in the United States,
please see our website and the 2024 Annual Report
under Note [30] to B Consolidated Financial Statements (Legal Risks).
It is of central importance for Bayer to offer farmers a
broad range of solutions to improve the sustainability
and productivity of their operations.
Glyphosate will continue to play an important role in
agriculture and in our product range. Additionally, we
plan to invest around €5 billion in the current decade
to research additional weed control methods and thus
provide farmers with more options in the future. This
includes the development of an entirely new herbicide

mode-of-action for broadacre weed control, the first in
the industry for over three decades. This molecule has
demonstrated effective control of key resistant grasses
in research and is expected to be commercialized toward the end of this decade.
In 2023, the European Commission renewed the approval of the active ingredient glyphosate in the EU for
10 years. This decision is based on EFSA’s safety evaluation for the renewal of the EU approval of glyphosate completed in July 2023. Following a comprehensive scientific review, EFSA concluded that glyphosate
fulfills all required approval criteria according to the EU
Plant Protection Regulation. EFSA published its conclusions and all background documents related to the
peer review and risk assessment on its website.
A proactive dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders
took place throughout 2023. This dialogue and information exchange was on behalf of the Glyphosate Renewal Group (GRG), national organizations such as the
German Glyphosate Working Group (GLAR) as well as
on behalf of Bayer or other GRG member companies.
The broad offer included a wide range of activities, for
example a bi-monthly GRG newsletter, press releases
and statements posted on the GRG website, along
with dialogue formats such as informative sessions
with stakeholders and regulators, not to forget online
webinars and media briefings with journalists.

Product monitoring

We provide our customers with comprehensive, transparent
and reliable information about our products and services in
accordance with our Group Regulation on Integrity & Responsibility in Communications and Marketing. Users of our
products can contact us through a range of communication
channels should they have inquiries or complaints, or if they

wish to report any incidents. These channels include both
direct contact with our sales staff and hotline numbers
printed on our product packaging.

products, more efficiently and to sustainably increase
productivity while protecting human and environmental
health.

We follow up on every incident relating to our crop protection and seed products reported anywhere in the world and
manage the incidents with the aid of a dedicated incident
management system. Reported incidents are classified
based on severity and risk. We have enacted clear guidance
on handling incidents through our Group Regulation on “External Adverse Incident Management for Crop Protection
Products”.

Utilizing these new technologies makes it possible to reduce
the resources needed for crop production, while also promoting the safe and responsible use of crop protection
products. For example, the use of satellite and drone data
means that even slight differences in the field can be taken
into account and crop protection products can be individually and precisely applied in the required amount only where
they are needed (targeted/zone/spot spraying plus variable
rate application).

Our incident management system and continuous product
use screenings form the key reference points when it comes
to monitoring the safety of our products and to identifying
necessary improvements. In general, steps to mitigate risks
can vary from increased training efforts, change of formulation, revised application recommendations and use limitations,
to product withdrawal. This is fully in line with the FAO/WHO
International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management and
the FAO Guidelines on Highly Hazardous Pesticides (HHPs).
Our incident management system also analyzes data from
national poison control centers, where available. We work
with hospitals and poison control centers to further improve
their incident management capability and data quality, also
with the support of CropLife International. Since 2022, we
have also engaged with medical professionals through our
Bayer Safe Use Ambassador Initiative, in which we encourage physicians in LMICs that do not have national incident
monitoring institutions to report any incidents related to the
use of our crop protection products directly to us.
Use of digital technologies

For Bayer, digital technologies are key enablers for creating
a better balance between agricultural productivity and environmental conservation. One of the goals of digital farming is
to use resources such as water, and crop protection

In 2024, Bayer continued its strategic partnership with major
drone-producing companies, for example for the targeted
treatment of crops with crop protection products. Through
these partnerships, we strive to provide farmers with reliable
and high-quality spray applications. At the same time, we
are collaborating with local professional drone spray service
providers, who are also interesting for regions with large
numbers of smallholder farmers as they can boost productivity and increase operator and farmer safety at the same
time. Through our Leaps by Bayer unit, we also invested in
two companies with their own drone application development programs.
We place emphasis on quality and safety throughout the trials we perform with drones. The existing guidelines on the
safe use of drones have been further refined. We worked together with regional CropLife organizations, such as
CropLife Asia and CropLife America, to frame guidance documents for the application of crop protection products
through unmanned aerial systems (UAS). In various countries, we conduct corresponding training courses for our
employees and those of our research partners, often virtually. To further refine guidelines and enrich the data set
needed for risk assessments, Bayer is engaged in various
initiatives, such as the OECD Working Party on Pesticides

Drone/Unmanned Aerial Spray Systems (UASS) Subgroup
and is playing a leading role in the Unmanned Aerial Pesticide Application System Task Force (UAPASTF). Bayer provided leadership in the UAPASTF effort to publish a best
management practice (BMP) document for UASS-based applications; this document is being utilized by stakeholders to
create national or regional BMP documents. We also supported the OECD Cooperative Research Program-funded
“Applying Pesticides Using Drones” conference held in York,
United Kingdom, in May 2023, aimed at developing aligned
best management practices for UAS applications of crop
protection products. Our employees working with regulatory
agencies in Australia and the United States have led the effort to establish an OECD Cooperative Research Programfunded conference aimed at developing recommendations
for how precision application technologies should be included in regulatory exposure and risk assessments and included on crop protection product labels; pending approval,
this conference will be held in Australia in February 2026.
Sensors on the latest tractors and harvesters can supply
important information on plant health and yield data. Along
with other data, this is incorporated into the digital applications developed by the digital farming unit of Bayer to
help farmers achieve more efficient and sustainable agricultural operations. We have taken a leadership role in the development of an OECD Working Party on Pesticide Community of Practice focused on creating the international
infrastructure needed to implement digital labels and use instructions that would eventually enable direct actions to be
implemented by software and machinery for crop protection
purposes. This project leverages our support for currently
running national/regional digital label projects (i.e. in Canada, United States and the EU).
With digital tools such as MagicScout and MagicTrap, a
digital yellow trap for pest monitoring, we aim for crop
protection products to be applied in the right amount and
only when needed, for example through faster identification

and documentation of causes of damage such as weeds,
pests and diseases.
Our digital farming platform Climate FieldView™ enables
farmers to use data to optimize their agricultural inputs
(costs) used on the field and to improve their output (yields).
This takes place through the sensor-based collection and
storage of large volumes of machine-generated agronomic
and machinery-related data directly in the farmers’ accounts. The application of this data not only enables farm
management to be economically sustainable by providing
higher return on investment but can also create substantial
advantages for the environment. Thanks to precision
agricultural machinery and digital tools, inputs such as
seeds, water and crop protection products are only used
when and where they are necessary. FieldViewTM is currently
available in North America, South America, Europe, Turkey,
South Africa and Australia.
We launched ForGround in 2022. This farmer-first digital platform offers growers tools and resources, as well as the potential to earn revenue through participation in the Bayer Carbon Program, for the adoption of more sustainable practices
such as cover cropping and reduced tillage. ForGround is expanding and evolving beyond carbon sequestration (part of
the Bayer Carbon Program) to explore other approaches and
collaborations that could enable farmers to make a positive
impact in their business operations and on the environment.
ForGround is currently available in North America.

To avoid point source discharges, Bayer recommends the
use of biological remediation systems such as Phytobac™,
which are offered by third-party manufacturers. Phytobac™
is designed to prevent water contamination with residues of
crop protection active ingredients generated during the filling
and cleaning of spraying devices or the disposal of residual
liquids. This solution is increasingly being used in several
countries. In Europe, more than 5,000 Phytobac™ systems
are currently in operation. Demonstration farms
using Phytobac™ systems have been implemented in
Australia, Canada, China, Thailand, Argentina, Brazil and
Colombia.
Further, we support the implementation of closed transfer
systems. Closed transfer systems help prevent spills of crop
protection products and hence help to further increase convenience, operational safety and environmental protection.
This is consistent with the CropLife Europe commitment to
making closed transfer systems universally available to European farmers and operators by 2030.
We jointly developed the “easyFlow” system with agrotop
GmbH, which has been available to farmers for several years
already. Additionally, Bayer has joined the cross-industry
group developing the “easyconnect” closed transfer system.
Work on the pilot for the system in the Netherlands is
ongoing, with the implementation now planned for the 2025
season.
Protecting pollinators and other beneficial insects

Water protection

Avoiding discharges of crop protection products into water
bodies is an important aspect of sustainable agriculture.
Alongside point source discharges into water bodies that
can occur during the handling of spraying devices, diffuse
substance discharges from treated fields can also play a
significant role. That is why many of our training measures
for farmers also focus on protecting water bodies in the
context of the correct use of our products.

Bees and other pollinators are important for sustainable food
production, and we also depend on healthy pollinators in our
seeds business. We are actively involved in various projects
and research activities to protect bees and other pollinators.
Bayer shares the concerns about currently declining insect
populations and has published a position on this issue. As
the causes of this decline have not yet been fully clarified,
we believe further scientific studies of the causes and the

development of corresponding countermeasures are urgently
needed. We have therefore established a dedicated working
group to address the issue and are involved in researching
the factors leading to this decline and developing measures
to counter the trend.
Our research supports farmers in food production, while
at the same time contributing to the health, safety and
biodiversity of pollinators. We promote dialogue with all
stakeholder groups through our global network. In cooperation projects worldwide, we have been looking into some of
the major stress factors for pollinators and into approaches
for protecting them. At the same time, we are engaged in
the development and implementation of approaches to protect insect biodiversity in the agricultural landscape, where
the current state of knowledge already allows for the definition of effective measures.
To reduce potential risks posed to pollinators by our crop
protection products, initial tests – particularly to measure
bee toxicity – are already being conducted at an early development stage to ensure that only products with an environmental profile that allows pollinator-safe use proceed to further development. Crop protection products are stringently
regulated and are subjected to thorough testing to make
sure they can be used safely. Extensive safety testing and
risk assessments enable us to recommend specific bee
safety measures to farmers.
Furthermore, we have contributed to the
creation of a new label pictogram (see
icon) designed by CropLife International
and published by the FAO of the United
Nations to be used as a precautionary
icon on labels for crop protection products
to protect pollinators. The new label pictogram serves on
the one hand to optimize global consistency in pollinator
safety labeling, and on the other hand puts emphasis on the
protection of wild pollinators beyond honeybees, and on

pollinator habitats. We have started to adopt this label pictogram for Bayer’s crop protection products containing imidacloprid.
Even beyond the regulatory requirements for pollinator
safety testing, our experts drive extensive activities in fundamental and applied research to ensure the pollinator safety
of our existing product portfolio.
In the early stages of product development, we have started
exploring digital phenotyping in honeybee toxicity screening
assays as well as computational modelling approaches with
the goal of further enhancing the mechanistic understanding
of the interaction of insecticides with pollinators to support
the targeted design of new molecules. In the area of toxicogenomics, we continue to drive research in the field of
bee pollinator toxicology using functional genomics and
other innovative technologies that contribute to the optimization of the bee safety profile of our products.
Another focus of our pollinator research is the regulatory
system that is designed to ensure the safety of pesticides to
bees, and its continuous optimization. In recent years, Bayer
scientists have been actively contributing to the development of optimized risk assessment programs in different regions of the world. This applies, for instance, to the revision
of the EFSA Bee Guidance Document in the EU, the activities of the Pollinator Research Task Force in the United
States, and the development of risk assessment programs in
Latin American countries.
Bayer is actively participating in the development of new
ecotoxicological testing systems, for instance for wild bees,
together with partners in academia, contract research organizations and authorities. Furthermore, Bayer experts
have, in collaboration with academic scientists, proactively
driven the development of modelling tools for ecotoxicological risk assessment. Finally, our experts are working with external research partners toward the development of digital

methods to advance the pollinator risk assessment for crop
protection products.
Our contributions go beyond the safety of our products; we
also contribute to approaches addressing pollinator health in
a holistic way. An example is the Healthy Hives research
partnership with Project Apis m. in North America, through
which we aim to identify and implement practical databased solutions to improve the health of honeybees as a key
pollinator of various crops.
Meta-studies on plants featuring Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)
technology (genetically modified plants that contain genes of
the soil bacterium Bt) have not identified any biologically relevant effects on honeybees. For more information, please
see chapter Focus on: Agriculture.
Bayer is one of the founding members of Growing Matters,
an initiative that fosters an open and scientific discourse on
stewardship, benefits and alternatives to neonicotinoid insecticides in North America. Together with its partners,
Growing Matters launched the BeSure! campaign, designed
to strengthen awareness and adoption of stewardship practices to protect bees and other pollinators during the handling, planting and disposal of neonicotinoid-treated seeds
and other neonicotinoid applications used during the growing season.

Neonicotinoids
The introduction of the neonicotinoid class of insecticides in the 1990s brought new features to improve
sustainability and to reduce the environmental impact
of insecticides in agriculture. Neonicotinoids replaced
older, frequently much more toxic insecticides, reinforced the concept of seed treatment minimizing
environmental exposure to agrochemicals, and

brought a broad spectrum of efficacy and a new mode
of action to assist integrated resistance and pest
management on many crops.
Some years after introduction, there were a few reports
of incidents where the use of neonicotinoid products
was associated with negative effects on bees. The
most severe example was when dust from treated
seeds was accidentally released during planting in
Germany in 2008, which resulted in significant
intoxication of bees nearby.
At Bayer, the incidents triggered a period of internal review/research into suitable risk mitigation measures or
product replacements. It also changed the risk assessment and profiling of existing and new products in Research and Development (e.g. systematically considering
toxicity to pollinators already in the early compound candidate selection process). Several initiatives and processes were introduced to minimize further risk through
the exposure of bees to neonicotinoids and other insecticides.
Since 2021, we have published details on the measures
we have taken in recent years in a separate report that
is updated on a yearly basis. We have also published
detailed information as appendices to the report.

95%
// Bayer’s invention of the Seed Treatment End Point
(STEP) technology, which enhances the quality of

In countries outside of the EU, competent authorities
regularly review neonicotinoids to assess the risks to
humans and the environment.

Through an app called HabiTally, which we developed together with Iowa State University in 2019, farmers and landowners can document the habitats they have created for
monarch butterflies and track the gains made in milkweed
(Asclepias) stems/acres across the United States. The app
enables better estimates of how much current habitat exists
and where, while also better facilitating further habitat planning and development. The United States Fish and Wildlife
Service can use the data as a component of their assessment of habitat availability for the monarch butterfly. For
more information, please see our website.

We believe that continuing to manufacture and market
neonicotinoids under the conditions authorized by regulatory authorities around the world is responsible,
beneficial and consistent with the UN Global Compact
environmental principles.

Disposal of containers and old inventories,

Processes are in place at Bayer to ensure the safe sell-off
of products, including the disposal of obsolete inventories
or waste.

Mitigating measures taken include the following:

collaborating with conservation groups, academic experts,
farmers and government agencies to find meaningful and
proactive ways to help these important pollinators thrive. We
are working to ensure that the growth of the wild plants
(esp. milkweed/Asclepias) that constitute the monarch butterfly’s main larval food source is supported along its migration routes outside of cultivated areas. Combined with a diversity of blooming plants throughout the seasons, this
habitat benefits not only monarchs but also many other insects, birds and mammals.

Populations of the migratory monarch butterfly, which is
common in North America, have declined in recent decades,
primarily due to the loss of milkweed in the United States,
habitat loss in the Mexican forests, weather extremes and
climate changes. Second, impacts from natural enemies,
crop protection products, disease, pathogens and parasites
are also possible contributing factors. To enhance the habitat for the monarch butterfly and other pollinators, Bayer is

The crop protection industry has set up voluntary initiatives
in various countries for the proper disposal of obsolete
stocks. As part of its activities in the international CropLife
association, Crop Science is also working with the FAO of
the United Nations and the World Bank to support the
proper collection and disposal of obsolete crop protection
products in Africa.

are not released into the environment and that empty containers are not improperly reused. As the proper disposal of
crop protection product containers is handled differently in
many countries, the crop protection industry collaborates
with authorities, distributors and farmers to establish or
maintain suitable disposal systems.
Bayer supports programs worldwide to ensure the safe recycling and disposal of empty packaging and containers. Users can learn about how to safely dispose of our products
through information on their labels.
We support the safe disposal of empty crop protection
product containers in many countries together with the
CropLife International industry association. As a result,
some 1.3 million metric tons of plastic have been collected
since 2005. This partnership has also facilitated the development of environmentally friendly packaging design programs, the implementation of training courses on the
proper handling of crop protection product containers for
distributors and farmers, and the testing of plastic recycling
options. Particularly successful disposal programs have
been established in Brazil, Canada, France, Germany and
Australia. In Brazil, more than 800,000 metric tons of empty
crop protection product containers have been disposed of
since 2002 through the National Institute for Processing
Empty Packages (inpEV) program.
In Germany, the crop protection industry partnered with agricultural wholesalers to develop the voluntary PAMIRA system for disposing of agrochemical packaging materials.
Crop protection product manufacturers cover the costs for
collection, logistics and utilization of packaging, while wholesalers provide the collection points. In 2023, around 3,100
metric tons of crop protection product and liquid fertilizer
packaging in Germany were returned free of charge to the
almost 400 collection points and disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner through the PAMIRA system.

authorizations, and from relevant standards, are regularly reviewed and integrated into our quality management system.

Quality and safety of pharmaceuticals and medical
devices
Extremely stringent safety standards for patients and medical professionals apply to pharmaceuticals and medical devices. That is why both the development and the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and medical devices are subject to
very strict quality requirements.

In addition to the internal quality assurance mechanisms, all
our sites are regularly inspected by the health authorities of
the respective countries to verify compliance with the various national and international requirements and certified
according to the respective product category (e.g. through
GMP certificates or in the form of a manufacturing license).
All our sites received the targeted certifications in 2024.

The quality management system of the Pharmaceuticals and
Consumer Health divisions is based on internationally recognized standards and applicable legal, regulatory and ethical
requirements for all stages of the provision of a pharmaceutical or a medical device – from development to registration,
production and distribution. In particular, these standards
include the rules for good working practice (GxP) in the
development and manufacture of pharmaceuticals – such
as Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), Good Distribution
Practice (GDP), Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Good Pharmacovigilance Practice (GVP), ISO certifications such as
those for the manufacture of medical devices (e.g. ISO
17025 and 13485), and the guidelines of the International
Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for
Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).

The quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and medical devices are always assessed relative to the possible
risks associated with their use. Such an assessment results
in a benefit–risk profile, which is crucial for the product’s approval and is also continuously reviewed thereafter. Accordingly, the Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health divisions
assess the medical benefit–risk profile of their pharmaceuticals and medical devices throughout their entire product life
cycle. For medical devices, the initial production and subsequent update of the benefit–risk profile are undertaken within
the scope of the quality management system. For pharmaceuticals, this takes place through a corresponding pharmacovigilance system.

Sustainability criteria for radiology products
Internal experts and external assessors regularly conduct
risk-based audits to verify compliance with the statutory requirements and relevant standards in development and production, as well as for registered product specifications.
Such audits also cover institutes subcontracted by Bayer,
service providers, our suppliers and contract manufacturing
organizations (CMOs). Deciding the frequency of audits at
CMOs follows the same risk-based approach as for internal
manufacturing sites. Observations made during these audits
are systematically evaluated, and compliance with corrective
measures is verified at regular intervals. The quality requirements derived from regulatory requirements, permits and

In the research and development (R&D) of new radiology products, we have begun introducing sustainability
criteria according to a “sustainability by design” approach. We want to examine the sustainability of future
radiology products at various stages of R&D using
sustainability checkpoints.

Safety in pharmaceutical development and production
Drug development is a complex and time-consuming process and is subject to stringent rules. The first step in developing a pharmaceutical is to find substances that can serve
as the starting material for a new active ingredient. The next
step is to test the new active ingredient – for example by using computational simulation processes, conducting tests in
cell or tissue cultures, or with the help of bacteria or animal
studies. These tests are prescribed by law and subject to
strict guidelines and governmental controls. For more information, please see chapter 3.4 Animal Welfare.

Before the pharmaceutical can then be submitted for approval, its efficacy, safety and tolerability must be examined
in various preclinical and clinical trials (Phases I-III).

With respect to clinical trials, we strictly align ourselves to
the Declaration of Helsinki, an ethical standard in place
since 1964 that regulates research conducted on humans.
This commitment is stipulated in our Human Rights Policy
and applies to all research institutes (clinical research

The active ingredient is then used to produce a safe and
easy-to-dose pharmaceutical. The requirements of the active ingredient and the product’s acceptance by patients
both play a role when developing a suitable delivery form
(such as a tablet or ointment). The dosage form must also
be such as to ensure that patients can safely dose the product and handle it easily.

Clinical trials
Clinical trials are an essential tool for determining the efficacy and safety of new drugs before they can be used to
diagnose or treat diseases. The benefits and risks of new
medicinal products must always be scientifically proven and
well documented. However, clinical trials are also necessary
to examine already approved products for new indications or
to confirm their safety profile.

organizations [CROs]) tasked with conducting clinical trials
on our behalf.
Additional statutory regulations, directives and ethical codes
supplementing the Declaration of Helsinki have been further
developed and introduced worldwide to ensure that the
health and safety of participants in clinical trials are the top
priority. We follow the Harmonized Guideline on Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on Harmonisation of
Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals
for Human Use – Good Clinical Practice, ICH-GCP). This international ethical and scientific standard for planning, implementing, documenting and reporting clinical trials in

human subjects ensures the rights, safety and well-being of
trial participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Its requirements include the deployment of an independent ethics committee for each clinical trial involving human subjects. Such ethics committees are based at university
hospitals, for example, and composed of medical experts
from various disciplines. A clinical trial on behalf of Bayer cannot begin without a positive vote from such an ethics committee. The commitment to complying with the ICH-GCP is also
included in the agreements with the CROs we commission to
conduct clinical trials.

Clinical trial phases
Stringent scientific and ethical principles apply to all
clinical trials involving humans. A trial protocol lays
out what is to be investigated, how the trial is to be
conducted and why it is necessary. It is approved by
the pharmaceutical regulatory authorities and an independent ethics committee. The voluntary trial participants are comprehensively informed in advance about
the planned trial and the possible risks. Their participation is subject to written consent that can be retracted
at any time, this having no impact on standard medical
care.
In Phase I, physicians investigate an active ingredient
with respect to its safety, tolerability and behavior in
the body of healthy trial participants. Blood values and
additional parameters are monitored, and it is determined how the ingredient is taken up, distributed, metabolized and excreted by the human body. In further
studies, physicians investigate interactions with other
pharmaceuticals or food. If an active ingredient proves
to be tolerated well in this phase, it is subsequently
tested on patients. Active ingredients with possible serious side effects, such as for the treatment of cancer
and other serious diseases (e.g. Parkinson’s), are
tested in patients from Phase I.
In Phases II and III, physicians examine how effective
the ingredient under investigation is, if at all, which
dose is ideal for treatment and how frequently side effects occur. To rule out distorted measurement results
as far as possible, the scientists compare the new active ingredient with an established therapy form or a
placebo that does not contain any active ingredient.
The patients do not know which group they belong to.
In what are known as double-blind, placebo-controlled

studies, the attending study team at the trial center
does not know which patient belongs to which group
either. Participants in a clinical trial conducted by
Bayer can contact the responsible investigator and/or
the contact person at the trial center who is listed in
the patient information at any time.
Physicians participating in a clinical trial keep records of
the treatments, measurement values and findings, and
forward the data to the drug producer in pseudonymized
form. Finally, the data is interpreted to determine whether
the results are medically relevant and the prospects for
seeking regulatory approval of the active ingredient in the
form of a drug product are promising. The clinical trials
last in total eight years on average. Additional clinical
studies (Phase IV, post-authorization safety studies) take
place following registration to further assess the benefit–
risk profile in the determination of the therapeutic value
of the product under practical conditions.
Bayer only conducts clinical trials in countries in which
there are plans to launch the respective drug product
onto the market. Once a clinical trial has concluded,
patients can be provided with the trial medication until
the date of approval and availability within the scope of
compassionate use programs or extension studies.

Wherever in the world we conduct clinical trials, they comply
with these strict international directives and high standards
of quality, as well as the respective applicable national laws
and standards. We review whether they comply with these
by means of risk-based audits, which also cover those trials
performed by the institutes we commission (CROs). Bayer
publishes information on clinical trials in compliance with the
respective local laws. Bayer publishes information on its own
clinical trials both in the publicly accessible registers and on
its own Clinical Trials Explorer website.

Summarized results of Phase II, III and IV clinical trials are
accessible online through the Clinical Trials Explorer – irrespective of whether the results of a study for one of our
products were positive or negative. Upon request, scientists
can receive access to anonymized data from clinical trials at
the patient level via Vivli, the website of the Center for Global
Clinical Research Data, provided the studies in question are
listed in the portal. Through this, Bayer observes the principles of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries
and Associations (EFPIA) and the Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) on the responsible
communication of clinical trial data, which were defined in a
joint position paper. Bayer is a member of Vivli, together with
other pharmaceutical companies and universities around the
world. In January 2022, Vivli was awarded funding by the National Institute of Health (NIH) in the United States to promote
the sharing of clinical trial data.
For further information about our globally uniform standards,
the monitoring of clinical studies and the role of the ethics
committees, please see our website.
We communicate transparently about our research and development activities. This needs to be done objectively, precisely and on a timely basis, and must conform with current
internal and external legal and ethical standards, including
those of Good Publication Practice (GPP). We disclose our
participation in scientific studies and publications of third
parties and the participation of third parties in the development of our publications. As a result, we act transparently
and grant access to scientific findings.

Easy-to-understand summaries
Since 2020, we have published clinical trial results on
our Clinical Trials Explorer website in language that is
easily understandable.
The results of Phases II through IV interventional trials
and of Phase I patient trials are generally published
within 12 months of the completion of the trial or – in
the event of premature termination – within 12 months
of the conclusion. We publish the summarized results
using clearly comprehensible formulations in English
and eight other globally important languages, along
with the languages of the countries in which the trial
was carried out. Bayer thus goes well beyond the
requirements of the EU regulation on clinical trials on
human pharmaceuticals that entered into force on
January 31, 2022.
In 2021, Reuters Events awarded Bayer the prize for
the Most Valuable Awareness Initiative for our commitment to making scientific research available to patients
in a comprehensible form. This recognizes Bayer’s
dedication to providing patients and all affected parties
with clear and easily understandable concepts, including in scientific publications.

Diversity in clinical trials
Bayer is committed to broadening access to clinical trials. By
enrolling participants who are representative of patient populations that may benefit from treatment, we gain valuable insights,
enhance treatment outcomes, and help address health disparities. In our Research & Development (R&D) efforts, aligned with
our mission, “Health for All, Hunger for None”, we are dedicated
to inclusive research by making our clinical trials more accessible to underrepresented communities and aim to reflect real-

world disease demographics. This reflects our dedication to
demonstrating scientific integrity while helping to build societal trust in the medical and research process.
To ensure health equity is foundational in our research and
development practices, Bayer consults and partners with a
variety of relevant stakeholders, including clinicians, scientists, health and regulatory authorities, ethics committees
and patient advocacy groups. In 2024, this commitment was
recognized through the receipt of the Reuters USA Health
Equity Award for our efforts to improve patient representation
in clinical trials.
In 2024, Bayer established key pillars for inclusive practice in
clinical trials, each designed to address critical barriers and
improve representation in research.
// Implementing sustained community engagement is vital
for building trust and increasing awareness of clinical trials. Bayer partners with health equity organizations and
actively engages underrepresented populations through
local events, community center collaborations and digital
outreach. For instance, in 2024, Bayer sponsored prostate cancer clinical research and conducted community
outreach at the Zero Prostate Cancer runs/walks in San
Antonio and Los Angeles, with the goal of building trust
by providing information about participation in clinical research.
// Improving access to clinical studies is essential for fostering a more positive patient experience and thereby enabling more patients to enter trials. Bayer partners across
the healthcare ecosystem to address community needs,
as demonstrated by our involvement in the 2024 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Industry Forum on Health Equity and Inclusive Research. Since
2022, Bayer has co-led initiatives with TransCelerate to
develop tools and educational resources aimed at improving representation of diverse patient populations. Additionally, through a partnership with the Academy for

Oncology Nurse Navigators (AONN), Bayer sponsored
training for Nurse Navigators focused on improving diversity in clinical research and enhancing patient support.
// Cultural competency and awareness: Bayer provides
training to all clinical research staff, equipping teams to
engage effectively and respectfully with underrepresented
populations. The aim being to actively engage with clinical
research staff to better understand and support access
for the intended patient population. Bayer raises awareness of inclusion of underrepresented groups in clinical
trials, for example, by supporting awareness of equity and
inclusion in research. Bayer supports SGM Alliance, a
US-based non-for-profit organization to educate and advocate for inclusive participating in clinical research. In
October 2024, Bayer participated in an industry panel
discussion coordinated by SGM Alliance to demonstrate
ways in which the pharmaceutical industry can commit to
greater representation in research.
Improving patient awareness and knowledge of clinical trials:
patient education is crucial for increasing trial participation
and ensuring informed decision-making. Bayer has developed tools and materials to enhance patient awareness,
supporting the consideration of trials as viable healthcare
options. In 2024, Bayer partnered with WomenHeart to raise
awareness about cell and gene therapy trials, developing
educational content on this topic.

Women and Health Equity: A Focus on Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)
Women experience significant disparities in health equity, particularly regarding CVD, which while being the
leading cause of death among women globally, remains under-recognized, underdiagnosed, and undertreated. These inequalities are especially pronounced
for women from historically underserved communities,

including those of color and economically disadvantaged backgrounds, as well as those in low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, women are underrepresented in clinical research, despite comprising
nearly half of the global population.
Bayer is committed to improving the representation of
women in clinical trials. A prime example is the OCEANIC-STROKE Study, an international Phase III randomized, placebo-controlled trial aiming to enroll
12,300 participants across 703 sites in 37 countries.
Alongside a Representative Enrollment Plan for US
sites, an Inclusive Research Committee is evaluating
barriers to trial enrollment for women in various countries. Their recommendations, combined with insights
from a patient council including underrepresented
groups, have led to an increase in global female
participation.
To address broader healthcare challenges, Bayer participated in the Global Heart Hub International
Roundtable Discussion on “Late, Missed, and Misdiagnosis of Heart Disease in Women” in April 2024,
held in Madrid, Spain. This patient-led initiative
brought together 27 participants from 15 countries,
including women with lived experience, patient organization leaders, public health experts, researchers and
clinicians. The roundtable led to a paper outlining key
challenges and calling for urgent global action to improve the treatment journey for women with cardiovascular disease.

Vulnerable patient populations
Vulnerable groups are defined as groups of people at a
higher risk of experiencing adverse health outcomes or facing
disparities due to various factors, such as women who are
pregnant or breastfeeding, children, minorities, people with

disabilities and elderly people. These special populations are
often at highest risk, yet are underrepresented in clinical trials. Consequently, health disparities among vulnerable populations may be exacerbated, meaning that these groups may
experience higher barriers to medical care and may not receive the same access to treatments and interventions, potentially leading to worse health outcomes.
Patient centricity and collaboration with key patient groups is
essential for identifying and addressing the comprehensive
needs of a specific population. Bayer's commitment to inclusivity for vulnerable populations was recognized through its
inclusion as a finalist in the “Driving Health Equity” category
at the Reuters Events: Pharma Awards Europe 2024, highlighting the company's success in advancing access to clinical trials and pioneering treatments for preterm infants.
In line with its commitment to health equity, Bayer has partnered with the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute
(Swiss TPH) and with the Drug for Neglected Disease Initiative
(DNDi) to combat neglected tropical diseases, such as onchocerciasis and specifically soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH).
These infections are caused by parasitic worms and affect
millions of people globally. They can lead to severe health issues such as malnutrition and anemia, seriously impacting
physical and cognitive development, especially in low-resource countries where healthcare access is limited. The collaborations focus on developing emodepside, a potentially
transformative treatment owing to its efficacy against different
helminth species, with concentrated efforts in Africa and Asia.
In 2024, the partnerships advanced through Phase II and prepared for Phase III trials, aiming to evaluate emodepside’s efficacy and safety at different regimens, ultimately ensuring that
effective treatments are accessible to those high-risk countries able to benefit from treatment and prevention strategies.
Additionally, the widespread distribution of these diseases
raises challenges for clinical research, particularly in providing
accurate information and education to vulnerable populations.
This highlights the importance of collaboration with academic

and public health institutions such as Swiss TPH and DNDi as
models of ethical public-private partnerships.
Pediatric development at Bayer

Children represent a significant portion of the global population. However, only about half of pediatric medications are
thoroughly evaluated by health authorities, often leading to
off-label prescriptions of adult drugs. To address this issue, it
is crucial to develop drug formulations specifically tailored to
children and conduct studies that ensure safety, efficacy and
proper dosing across all age groups. However, pediatric clinical trials face ethical and recruitment challenges, particularly
in protecting children's rights and recruiting participants for
rare disease studies.
Bayer is dedicated to advancing innovative research methodologies and data collection aimed at developing effective
treatments for young patients. Our commitment goes beyond
regulatory requirements, as we actively engage with patients,
parents and care partners from the outset of each pediatric
study program. Furthermore, we prioritize communication of
study material in clear, age-appropriate language, ensuring
that children and their families can easily understand the information relevant to their care.
A prime example of our commitment to pediatric drug development is the PATENT-CHILD study, which explores the use
of riociguat for treating pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a rare and serious condition affecting the blood
vessels in the lungs. In 2024, the European Medicines
Agency (EMA) approved pediatric-specific tablets for PAH
treatment in patients under 18 years old and weighing at
least 50kg, specifically those classified as World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class (FC) II to III. This approval
was made possible through advanced pharmacokinetic modeling techniques that extrapolated data from adult trials (PATENT-1 and PATENT-2) to pediatric populations. Such innovative approaches streamline the research process and
facilitate the effective adaptation of treatments from adults to

children, overcoming significant barriers typically faced in pediatric drug development.
In addition to PATENT-CHILD, Bayer is advancing several
other important programs to address critical unmet needs in
pediatric populations. The ongoing FIONA study is evaluating
finerenone for children with congenital chronic kidney disease
(CKD) and proteinuria. Furthermore, we are investigating
treatments for rare diseases that impact pediatric patients,
including pediatric heart failure, gene-inherited Limb-Girdle
Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) and Pompe disease.
Bayer’s commitment to pediatric drug development not only
enhances treatment options for children but also underscores
a broader dedication to ensuring that vulnerable populations
receive the safe and effective care they deserve.
Approval process
The respective documentation submitted to the regulatory
authorities contains the research results from the Phase I to
III clinical trials and the data generated for a pharmaceutical
during its development. It includes both the data from the
developmental phases, such as chemical-pharmaceutical
and toxicological data, and a comprehensive benefit–risk
assessment of the pharmaceutical. A new pharmaceutical
must comply with all regulatory safety requirements to secure marketing authorization. The same applies to medical
devices, dietary supplements and medicated skincare products. Based on these documents, the regulatory authority
assesses whether the efficacy, safety and quality of the
pharmaceutical have been demonstrated for the intended indication. The product is only approved if its benefit–risk ratio
has been assessed as positive.
As each country has its own strict regulations for drug development, product approval and market launch, we work
closely with the respective national regulatory authorities to
ensure that we act in a compliant manner at every development stage. The authorities in other countries often take the

assessments of the EMA and/or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) into consideration in their own evaluations.

Key regulatory authorities for Bayer are:
// The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
// The European Medicines Agency (EMA)
// The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency
(PMDA) in Japan
// The National Medical Products Administration
(NMPA) in China

Drug safety
The preclinical and clinical trials prescribed for pharmaceutical
research investigate drug candidates regarding their quality,
safety and efficacy. At the same time, the genesis and progression of a disease differ from one person to another, and
the effect of a drug product can vary accordingly. We continue
to observe and evaluate our products following their approval
and throughout their entire life cycle. This enables adverse effects to be identified at an early stage and a decision to be
taken as regards the necessary risk mitigation measures.
The collection and evaluation of safety-relevant information
about our products are the responsibility of the global Patient and Drug Safety (Pharmacovigilance) department, in
which scientific and medical experts from various disciplines
work together in safety management teams (SMTs). These
teams evaluate internal benefit and safety data, clinical trials,
post-marketing studies, external databases and scientific
publications to identify potential safety concerns at an early
stage and detect possible changes in the benefit–risk profile.
All reported side effects are entered into our pharmacovigilance database. The evaluation of information about a benefit–risk profile applies not just to pharmaceuticals and medical devices but also to dietary supplements and medicated
skincare products. This information is regularly evaluated in

collaboration with the regulatory and oversight authorities at
both national and international level.
As it is particularly important to not just collect data during
the clinical development of a medical product but also to
monitor the product after marketing authorization has been
granted, if required, we conduct Phase IV studies (post-authorization safety studies) to investigate rare or very rare side
effects, for example. As a pharmaceutical manufacturer, we
receive reports on side effects either directly or through the
health authorities, as well as through stakeholders such as
physicians, pharmacists or patients themselves. Suggestions
derived from these reports regarding possible supplementary
safety-relevant information for the package inserts are passed
on to the regulatory authorities by us. Such suggestions usually come to the authorities from the respective pharmaceutical manufacturers. The relevant health authorities decide on
the steps resulting from the reports and suggestions in close
cooperation with us as the producer.
Should risks be identified, we immediately take steps to
safeguard the health of patients and consumers in coordination with the authorities. These measures range from updating product information for patients, users, pharmacists and
physicians through patient education brochures and further
training measures for medical professionals to direct communication with medical experts (Direct Healthcare Professional Communication [DHPC]) and even product withdrawals. Implementation of risk mitigation activities is coordinated
by our local SMTs in the country organizations.
All these processes are documented, regularly updated and
integrated into the quality management system. To maintain
the high quality of Bayer’s pharmacovigilance system, our
medical and scientific experts undergo regular training.
Furthermore, in line with our Group Regulation, all Bayer employees are required to undergo training as regards their obligation to immediately report safety- and quality-relevant information to the Pharmacovigilance department. We

regularly test whether the pharmacovigilance system can
cope with emergency situations such as pandemics.
The information that we compile on side effects is reported
to the national health authorities in the relevant countries,
where it is required. As processes in the EU are centralized, European marketing authorization holders such as
Bayer are now required to enter all suspected cases of undesirable side effects directly into EudraVigilance, the European Medicines Agency’s electronic information system,
rather than reporting them to the 27 national authorities individually.
Large data volumes must be analyzed to identify relevant information in the drug safety process. Where it makes sense,
Bayer employs automation technologies, artificial intelligence
(AI) and machine learning. This enables side effects to be
discovered at an earlier stage, meaning that risk mitigation
measures can be implemented faster, which in turn helps to
further improve patient safety.

About AI in radiology
Aging populations and changing lifestyles are leading
to an increase in chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Consequently, the demand for medical imaging to detect diseases, guide
treatment decisions and support therapy planning is
growing – bringing additional challenges such as staff
and budget shortages.
AI comes with the value proposition of aiding diagnosis and increasing the throughput of radiological examinations.
In the area of medical imaging, Bayer offers Calantic™
Digital Solutions, a cloud-hosted platform including digital radiology AI-enabled applications that assists

radiologists and their teams. Such AI applications are
developed by specialized partner companies and integrated into the IT systems of medical staff via Calantic™.
The vendor-neutral, cloud-hosted platform includes a
growing number of applications designed to aid prioritization and lesion detection, as well as apps that automate routine tasks and measurements, improve radiology suites’ workflow and help medical staff to spend
more time on patients and their diagnosis. For more
information, please see our website.

Trace substances of active pharmaceutical ingredients
in the environment
Our Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health divisions carry
out ecotoxicological investigations on active pharmaceutical
ingredients. These investigations serve as the basis for the
environmental risk assessments within marketing authorization for human pharmaceuticals in Europe and the United
States, as well as in other geographies. In line with legal requirements, we thus evaluate possible environmental risks
that could result from the intended use of human pharmaceuticals. The results of these environmental risk assessments are outlined in general terms in the specialized information for physicians. This information includes details on
how to properly dispose of expired or unused pharmaceuticals so that users are able to avoid unnecessary environmental emissions. These details are also included in the
packaging inserts.
We take additional action in our production facilities to minimize discharges of pharmaceuticals into the environment
based on risk-oriented assessment parameters. For more information, please see chapter 7. Environment.
In some cases, monitoring can detect active pharmaceutical
ingredients in environmental media as trace substances, in

other words in low concentrations. According to an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
publication from 2021, discharge into the environment in
these cases occurs primarily through patients’ excreta, as
well as partially through the improper disposal of unused
and expired medicines, and from hospitals. According to
this report, discharges into the environment via pharmaceutical production facilities are minor. The main path of entry
into the environment for these trace substances is through
wastewater discharged into surface waters such as rivers or
the sea, as current treatment plants are not always able to
eliminate trace substances sufficiently.
In some areas, surface water is used as a source of drinking
water. However, current knowledge indicates that the trace
substance concentrations of active pharmaceutical ingredients
measured in drinking water are harmless to human health. This
assumption is based partly on the findings of the WHO’s Drinking Water Parameter Cooperation Project report of 2017.
Among the aspects studied in this report were the concentrations of active pharmaceutical ingredients measured in environmental media and mixtures of such substances measured in
drinking water. The report found that there were no immediate
health risks and consequently no need to act in the short term.
This has been confirmed by more recent studies. Against the
backdrop of a potential increase in the use of pharmaceuticals
and to further guarantee the safety of drinking water resources,
the WHO recommends that the discharge of trace substances
be observed comprehensively over a longer period of time.
In addition to human health, there is now a focus on the environmental impact of pharmaceutical trace substances. Such
trace substances are the subject of scientific publications
and a matter of public interest. The European Commission
also acknowledges the issue of trace substances, including
those from medicinal products, in the environment. Strategic
approaches to managing pharmaceuticals in the environment
have been published in connection with the Pharmaceuticals
Strategy initiated in 2020 and were specified with the

proposal of the European Commission on the review of the
pharmaceutical legislation in Europe in April 2023.
For many years, the pharmaceutical industry has also been
addressing the issue of trace substances from medicinal
products in the environment and the environmental risk assessment of active ingredients. Between 2015 and 2019, for
example, an initiative of the manufacturers’ associations
EFPIA, Association Européenne des Spécialités Pharmaceutiques Grand Public (AESGP) and Medicines for Europe put
together key points for a strategic approach to dealing with
pharmaceuticals in the environment and developed possible
solutions to this problem. This initiative, which is supported
by Bayer, focused partly on expanding the current legally required risk assessment for active pharmaceutical ingredients
within the scope of the pharmaceutical marketing authorization process. At the end of 2022, the three pharmaceutical
associations published a position paper that proposed specific improvements under the designation of an “extended
Environmental Risk Assessment” (eERA). Another focus was
the development of a concept for analyzing and managing
wastewater from pharmaceutical production facilities. This is
currently being implemented at Bayer, please see chapter 7.
Environment.
For the first time, a database of environmental information
for active pharmaceutical ingredients was created in the EU
within the scope of the International Panel on the Information Environment (iPiE), enabling a comprehensive, transparent and comprehensible overview of more than 2,000
studies on the environmental behavior of active pharmaceutical ingredients already on the market. Scientific evaluations
of the database have found that only a few of the registered
active ingredients pose a potential environmental risk. These
primarily include hormones or antibiotics, which impact the
environment even at very low concentrations and are also
marketed by companies such as Bayer.

Bayer is also active in the iPiE follow-up project Innovative
Medicines Initiative (IMI) PREMIER (Prioritisation and Risk
Evaluation of Medicines in the Environment). More than 25
public- and private-sector partners currently participate in
PREMIER, including public authorities, universities and
EFPIA companies. This IMI project, scheduled to run from
2020 until 2026, is geared toward continuing and expanding
the iPiE database. The objectives of PREMIER include making more data and details on the studies publicly accessible
and providing modeling and evaluation tools. Furthermore, it
aims to develop strategies and processes that enable the
prioritization of active ingredients for which little or no environmental data is currently available (there has only been a
legal obligation to conduct an environmental risk assessment in the EU since 2006). The goal is to identify the active
ingredients that can lead to heightened risks in the environment. The intention is to generate new environmental data
for these prioritized active ingredients and enable risk assessments to be performed on them. This in turn will obviate
the need for unnecessary studies – such as those involving
vertebrates (fish) – for active ingredients classified as unproblematic. PREMIER also aims to research and promote
options for more environmentally friendly active ingredient
design.

re:contrast

As part of our re:contrast program, we take back residues
of our iodinated X-ray contrast agent iopromide and our
gadolinium-containing contrast agent gadobutrol from our
customers. This makes it possible to avoid unnecessary
environmental discharges and properly reuse the iodine or
gadolinium in an industrial cycle. Once contrast agent containers have been opened, their contents need to be quickly
used. Collection enables iodine and gadolinium contained in
residues of unused contrast agents from doctor’s surgeries,
hospitals or radiology centers to be reused. The residues are
collected in special containers that can be obtained from
Bayer for free and that an external service provider picks up
on our behalf. This makes our system customer-friendly and
participation easier for medical personnel.
Iodine recovery is already a common practice in Bayer's
contrast agent production. Tons of iodine have already been
recovered using our patented process and fed back into
the value chain. The recovered iodine can be used for many
different purposes, but not for the production of contrast
agents themselves as the legal quality requirements for
medicinal products do not permit this.

Bayer also remains involved in the stakeholder dialogue initiated by the German government with the goal of drawing up
a strategy for dealing with trace substances in bodies of water. In roundtable formats that bring together stakeholders
from water management, environmental authorities and associations, health service providers and industry, measures
are developed that aim to reduce the discharge of relevant
trace substances.

Focus on: Access to Healthcare
Millions of people in many parts of the world do not have access to basic medical care. According to the World Health
Organization (WHO), there are various reasons for this – a
lack of medicines, poverty, a lack of or inadequately trained
medical personnel, a lack of political will and insufficient access to medical data.
As a leading pharmaceutical company, we believe we have a
responsibility to improve access to healthcare for all. For this
reason, we are focusing on areas in which we can have the
biggest impact by leveraging our scientific know-how, products, partnerships and global network.
In accordance with our strategy, we aim to fulfill the need of
100 million women in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs) for modern contraception by 2030. We also want to
support 100 million people in economically or medically underserved communities with self-care interventions from
Bayer by 2030. For more information, please see the Sustainability Strategy chapter. Responsibility for implementing
the access to healthcare strategy lies with the heads of the
Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health divisions, both of
whom are members of the Board of Management of Bayer
AG due to their positions. The Supervisory Board of Bayer
AG monitors the attainment of the established goals.
It is also our ambition to improve access to our prescription
products for people in LMICs through improved availability
and modified drug pricing, as well as through our patient
access programs.
We have implemented strategies for improving access to
healthcare throughout the value chain.

Access to Medicine Index
Since 2008, the Access to Medicine Foundation has
published a ranking of the 20 biggest pharmaceutical
companies. The Access to Medicine Index evaluates
the companies’ measures to make medicines and diagnosis more easily accessible to people in LMICs.
Bayer was ranked 10th in 2024. This means that Bayer
has achieved a top ten ranking in a second consecutive assessment cycle. This accomplishment aligns
perfectly with our sustainability strategy, where we set
the ambitious goal for ourselves to be among the top
ten. Notably, our ranking has improved from 16th
place in 2018 to 13th place in 2020 (which was published in 2021), 9th place in 2022, and 10th place in
this index. We are particularly proud of our 4th place
ranking in the “Governance of Access” category, which
signifies our commitment to ensuring equitable access
to our medicines globally.

Family Planning
The ability of girls and young women to complete their education and thus improve their opportunities for a self-determined life is highly dependent on family planning options.
For this to happen, they must be able to make their own
well-founded decisions about whether to have children, and,
if so, how many and when. Knowledge about their own sexuality and access to modern family planning are crucial to
helping young people make important life decisions. Furthermore, both education and conversations about family planning strengthen gender equality and the role of women
worldwide. That is why access to voluntary family planning
has been an established human right for more than 50 years.

According to the United Nations, more than 200 million
women in LMICs would like to prevent pregnancy but do not
use safe and effective family planning methods. According
to the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) and the studies of the Copenhagen Consensus
Center, investment in family planning is a “best buy” for development that can support the attainment of various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Family planning provides the foundation for more equality, education and
affluence, and plays a crucial role in reducing poverty (SDG
1) and hunger (SDG 2), improving health (SDG 3) and increasing participation in high-quality education (SDG 4). It
also strengthens gender equality (SDG 5), which in turn is a
crucial factor in future economic and social development.
Collaborations
Bayer works together with international partners to improve
education on sexual and reproductive health with a focus on
contraceptive options. Back in 2007, in close cooperation
with our partners, we’ve launched World Contraception Day
(WCD), September 26, as an official awareness day that
puts sexual rights and contraception in focus. The associated year-round Your Life information campaign is directed
at young people and pursues the vision of a world where
every pregnancy is wanted. WCD and Your Life are supported by a coalition of over a dozen international partners.
The campaign has a dedicated website, www.your-life.com,
where young people can get accurate and unbiased information on contraception. The content is presented in a
straightforward, interactive and relatable way, without judgement or lectures. It seeks to address the needs and questions of a young audience, counter common myths and misconceptions, and provide guidance and preparation for a
well-informed discussion about different contraceptive

methods with a healthcare professional. The online presence
is complemented by the Your Life social media channels on
Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, as well as the YOURLA
chatbot. By means of user surveys, we have generated a
sound database for assessing the conversion of women
reached via social media into users of modern contraception. The datapoints suggest that a relevant number of
women – who often lack alternative ways of engaging on
sexual and reproductive health topics – can be reached and
educated to choose a modern contraceptive. We are elaborating ways of reporting these important activities in our goal
to address the unmet need for family planning.
Access to family planning products is not adequately guaranteed in many regions of the world. As a global leader in
women’s health, Bayer is a longstanding partner of international family planning programs. Bayer’s contraceptive products are made available there at preferential prices.
Irrespective of whether its own products are used, Bayer
has been providing financial support to The Challenge Initiative (TCI) – a family-planning program based at Johns Hopkins University and implemented by the Bill & Melinda Gates
Institute for Population and Reproductive Health – since July
2020. TCI aims to establish various family planning options
on a broad scale quickly and sustainably. The program is
currently being implemented in more than 210 Asian and African cities. In total, approximately 5 million women received
access to voluntary family planning with the help of TCI
since Bayer became a partner in 2020. Bayer is an anchor
partner of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in preclinical
research pertaining to nonhormonal contraception. We undertake to make such a product available in LMICs at an affordable price as soon as it has been approved by the health
authorities following the development phase.
Since 2007, Bayer has been a member of the Reproductive
Health Supplies Coalition (RHSC), a global partnership of
public, private and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).

3. Product Stewardship

5. Human Rights

6. Employees

The RHSC endeavors to ensure that people in LMICs can
access affordable and high-quality contraceptives.
In addition, Bayer worked together with the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA), USAID and international NGOs
to make hormonal contraceptives such as birth control pills,
three-month injections, implants and coils available. As a
strategic partner, we also provide support with expertise in
the areas of supply, logistics and product registration.
In accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) of the United Nations (particularly SDG 3.7 and 5.6),
the UNFPA and Bayer have a common vision: to measurably
increase the number of women who can meet their need for
modern contraceptives. The intention is to reach this goal
through interventions supported by this collaboration, with
the objective of strengthening the autonomy and resilience of
local health systems by focusing on four specific areas:
measures to sustainably develop their structure and expertise
(capacity building); supply chain management; innovation;
and gender equality, inclusion and diversity at the workplace.
We therefore concluded further cooperation agreements
with the UNFPA in 2022, and Bayer became the first company to join the UNFPA Equalizer Accelerator Fund. In 2024,
these initial agreements were extended to 2026, and Bayer
also joined the UNFPA Coalition for Reproductive Justice in
Business as a Champion for Women's Health in Business.
Current status
We currently provide contraceptives to 51 million women
in LMICs. More than a third of these women are reached
through commercial distribution channels – particularly in
upper-middle-income countries. In contrast, the majority of
women in low- and lower-middle income countries – gain
access through the international development network, such
as through UNFPA or participating national family planning
programs. Shipments provided through such programs are
usually free of charge for the women. To address the

9. Social Engagement

challenges associated with facilitating access to contraceptives over the next decade and reach our target of enabling
100 million women to access modern contraceptives, we are
continuously expanding our partnerships and increasing our
production capacities.

Global Health Unit
Bayer has established the Global Health Unit (GHU) to
further enhance access to medicines and eliminate
barriers for underserved populations, primarily, but not
exclusively, in more than 50 low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs) where Bayer Pharma has no or limited presence. The GHU focuses on women's
healthcare, cardiovascular diseases, ophthalmology,
oncology, and neglected tropical diseases, employing
innovative partnerships and local initiatives to meet diverse community needs. A key objective is to fulfill the
need of 100 million women in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs) for modern contraception by 2030
and address neglected tropical diseases as well as
non-communicable diseases.

For more information on our Group target, please see the
Sustainability Strategy chapter or our website.
Expansion of production capacities
We approved capital expenditures of more than €400 million
to expand the contraceptive production facility at our site in
Finland and build a new plant in Costa Rica. The site in Finland is preparing for market supply, and the Costa Rica site
has got Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) approval, now
preparing for the supply of long-acting reversible contraceptives (implants and hormonal intrauterine devices) to LMICs.

Access to Self-Care
More than half the world’s population does not have access
to basic, vital medical services because the people do not
have sufficient income, live in medically underserved regions
or cannot access hospitals, pharmacies or other treatment
options for various reasons. This means that billions of people rely on self-care to prevent diseases, maintain their
health or treat illnesses.
We want to support 100 million people in economically or
medically underserved communities with self-care interventions from Bayer by 2030. As a leading supplier of medical
self-care products, we are present in many countries and
regions in which people depend on self-care, and already
reached 73 million people in 2024, including our strategic
investments in India. For more information, please see the
Sustainability Strategy chapter.

Neglected Tropical Diseases
(NTDs)
Together with other pharmaceutical companies, Bayer plays
an important role in fighting NTDs. Bayer supports the WHO
NTD road map 2021–2030, which aims to permanently eliminate two NTDs by 2030. For over 20 years, we have provided the WHO with two essential drugs to treat African
sleeping sickness and Chagas disease in Latin America free
of charge. We also provide funding for logistics and the distribution of these drugs in the affected countries, as well as
for other activities. Bayer reaffirmed its commitment in 2022
by signing the Kigali Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases.
African sleeping sickness
Sustained control efforts have reduced the number of new
cases by 97% in the last 20 years. The disease has thus
been eliminated as a global public health problem after
decades of efforts.

Chagas disease
Currently, between six and seven million people are infected
with the Chagas disease pathogen. Less than 1% of those
infected have access to adequate diagnosis and treatment
of the disease. Newborn babies and children are at particular risk because infected, and in some cases asymptomatic,
mothers can pass on the pathogen to their unborn children.
Our preclinical and clinical research has resulted in the development of a formulation of our active ingredient nifurtimox
that is suitable for children, and this was approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2020.
Approval was granted in Bolivia in 2021, making it the first
Latin American country in which this formulation is available.
As nonendemic countries, Germany and Spain registered
the product in 2024. The formulation enables the drug to be
precisely dosed for children based on body weight. It also
has better solubility and is easier to administer, which means
it can be given to infants aged zero to two years. That
makes this formulation of nifurtimox the first Chagas treatment approved for this age group.
Bayer signed a letter of intent for a cooperation agreement
with the Brazilian Institute for pharmaceutical technology
(Farmanguinhos/Fiocruz) to supply nifurtimox directly to the
Brazilian government in the future. This is an important step
in facilitating access to effective treatment via government
programs.
Pork tapeworm
Bayer also supports the WHO in the fight against infection
with the pork tapeworm (Taenia solium), which is transmitted
through the consumption of raw or insufficiently cooked
pork. When people and pigs live closely together in unhygienic conditions, infection can also occur when the tapeworm’s eggs are excreted with feces. The disease is asymptomatic but can also attack the brain in the late stages if left
untreated (neurocysticercosis). Infection with the pork tapeworm at this stage has led to epilepsy in about 13 million

people, accounting for about one-third of all epilepsy cases
in the affected countries. Bayer provides two essential drugs
to treat pork tapeworm infection, and financially supports
the logistics and distribution of the medicines within the
scope of national programs to eliminate the illness.
Onchocerciasis
Since 2014, Bayer has worked together with the Drugs for
Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) to develop an active ingredient for the treatment of onchocerciasis. The first clinical
trials in humans (Phase II) began in mid-2020. The preparation of the Phase III clinical trial started in 2024.Transmitted
by threadworms, this tropical disease leads to incurable river
blindness in about 10% of chronically ill patients. Some
30 million people around the world are infected with these
threadworms, of whom more than 99% live in Africa.
Soil-transmitted helminths
A partnership between Bayer and the Swiss Tropical and
Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) started in 2023, with the
Phase III clinical trial beginning in 2024. This was launched
with the aim of jointly developing an effective therapy for
people infected with soil-transmitted helminths. Worldwide,
more than 1.5 billion people are infected with at least one
soil-transmitted helminth species, with the highest prevalence reported in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and South America.
ESCulab
Furthermore, Bayer is a member of the European ESCulab
project (European Screening Centre; unique library for attractive biology) of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI),
which seeks drugs that will treat neglected tropical diseases
and malaria effectively, among other objectives.

Further Engagement
Noncommunicable diseases are a major challenge, particularly in LMICs. More than three-quarters of deaths from

cardiovascular disease occur in LMICs. Between 1990 and
2013, sub-Saharan Africa was the only geographic region in
the world to register an increase in deaths due to cardiovascular disease. The number of cardiovascular patients is expected to double by 2030. For this reason, Bayer is working
to develop model projects to establish an integrated diagnosis, treatment and continuing education concept for cardiovascular diseases.
The Ghana Heart Initiative (GHI), which Bayer supported in
partnership with the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) and local health authorities in Ghana, ran for six
years until August 2024 and aimed to facilitate more specific
drug access programs by strengthening the healthcare system. The proven impact of the intervention is demonstrated
by the increase in the percentage of patients diagnosed with
hypertension and reaching controlled blood pressure levels
through treatment from a national average of 5–7% to an
average of over 70% in participating facilities.
This was achieved based on newly developed national
guidelines for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and
the involvement of over 6,000 medical specialists who were
trained to diagnose and treat these illnesses and a total of
nine centers of expertise that were established to diagnose
and treat deep vein thrombosis. For further information,
please see the Ghana Heart Initiative website.
Building on the impact of the GHI, Bayer, together with GIZ
International Services, local authorities, additional pharmaceutical companies – Eli Lilly, represented by Panorama
Global, and Sanofi – and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, formed a new collaborative project called AYA – Integrated Healthcare Initiative. AYA was launched in September
2024 and is aimed at further strengthening Ghana's
healthcare system with a focus on cardiovascular diseases
and type 2 diabetes.

The AYA Initiative’s key goals are the following: capacity
building for healthcare providers, improved access to medical equipment for cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes, facilitation of screening and linkage to counselling and
care, empowering of patient self-management for chronic
conditions, and strengthening of data collection systems for
better healthcare outcomes.
Social commitment, access programs and innovative, inclusive business models jointly contribute to the implementation
of our “Health for all, Hunger for none” mission. For more information, please see chapter 9. Social Engagement.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
AMR is an increasing problem in healthcare, and suitable antibiotics are urgently needed. Therefore, together
with other pharmaceutical companies, we support the
AMR Action Fund, which aims to bring two to four additional antibiotics to market maturity by 2030 to address AMR. The development of these antibiotics
would otherwise be jeopardized by funding problems.

Equitable Drug Pricing
The cost of medicines can present a major obstacle for patients, especially when they have to pay for this themselves.
This is particularly true in LMICs, most of which do not have
universal health coverage for the reimbursement of medicinal
and treatment cost. We are therefore working on various options, including in collaboration with charitable organizations
and governmental authorities, on the one hand to provide
more patients with improved access to much-needed medicines, and on the other hand to optimize the therapeutic
benefit of the medication by giving patients the chance to
prolong their drug therapy. For most of our key products
(Adempas™, Eylea™, Kerendia™, Kyleena™, Mirena™,

9. Social Engagement

Nexavar™, Stivarga™, Verquvo™ and Xarelto™), including
specific new launches, we have established the framework
conditions for adjusted, equitable pricing that also accounts
for per capita gross national income. This enables us to be
increasingly flexible in taking decisions under consideration
of local purchasing power, allowing patients to benefit more.

Patient Access Programs
Our patient access programs help patients in LMICs to
better overcome financial obstacles to being able to afford
prescribed medications and access them in a timely manner
or, on a long-term basis, to give patients not only reliable access to drugs but also in a sustainable way. We cooperate
with insurance providers, charitable organizations and other
partners to advance these options. Our patient access programs are developed according to the framework conditions
in each country and take account of the needs of patients,
supporting them in different ways, e.g.:
// Individual assessment of patients’ financial solvency and
derivation of a corresponding financing and treatment
plan
// Reduction of the financial burden on patients, for example
through the provision of free and payment-based medicines or the granting of discounts on the original
selling price
For more information, please see our website.

Patents in low-income countries (LICs)
In LICs, Bayer does not register or enforce patents for
human pharmaceuticals. This applies as long as a
country retains the status of an LIC according to the
World Bank classification and the country’s

We have also joined the Patent Information Initiative
for Medicines (Pat-INFORMED), which provides basic
patent information on our registered products, making
it available to the public to facilitate the procurement
of medicines, particularly in LICs.

The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines that should
be available in functioning healthcare systems has been
published by the WHO since 1977 and includes various
medicines produced and sold by Bayer. We generated
some €7.7 billion through sales of these products in 2024
(equivalent to about 17% of total Bayer sales).

4.1 Management Approach

4. Procurement
As a global company, Bayer procures services and materials
from all over the world. We align our procurement and supplier management processes to ambitious ethical, social and
environment-related principles. We expect our suppliers to
observe these principles, too, and we support them in doing
so. Through this approach, we help to improve sustainability
in our supply chain.

4.1 Management Approach
The procurement organization supplies the company with
raw materials, goods and services all around the world. It
acts on behalf of all divisions and Enabling Functions, leveraging synergies by bundling know-how and procurement
spend. The head of Procurement reports directly to the
Chief Financial Officer.
We exert influence on society and the environment through
our procurement activities and supplier relationships. In addition to this, economic, ethical, social and ecological principles are all anchored in our Bayer Code of Conduct which is
binding for all employees worldwide.
Procurement operates according to established procurement and supplier management processes. As both the
market and supply chain management are very dynamic and
constantly evolving, long-term contracts and active supplier
management for strategically important goods and services
are important elements here. They serve to minimize procurement-specific risks such as supply bottlenecks or significant price fluctuations, and to safeguard the company’s
competitiveness and ensure smooth production processes.

Sustainability in procurement
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on S2 Workers in the Value Chain, E2 Pollution
and G1 Governance.
We have integrated sustainability aspects into our supplier
management to ensure that the way we conduct business
with our suppliers is in line with environmental, social and
ethical standards. Bayer regards adherence to these sustainability standards within the supply chain as a crucial factor.
By acting responsibly in collaboration with our suppliers, we
aim to identify and minimize risks and create stable, longterm business relationships with our partners. This is also
an important strategic lever for Bayer in safeguarding both
its global competitiveness and the supply of materials and
services. For this reason, the company applies not just economic standards, but also sustainability standards in
choosing new suppliers or continuing its relationships with
existing ones. These principles are defined in Bayer’s
SCoC, which generally forms the basis for our collaboration
with suppliers.

Supplier Code of Conduct
Bayer has developed a SCoC which sets forth key social, ecological and ethical standards that the Bayer
Group expects its suppliers and subcontractors to
share. This code applies globally to all our potential
and selected suppliers. It is included in all purchase
orders and forms an integral part of all contract negotiations.

Bayer supports the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) on Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption as well as the
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights (UNGPs) and the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises. The Bayer SCoC is based
on, among other international standards, the UNGC,
the International Bill of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the UNGPs,
the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, the UN Convention Against Corruption, the
Convention on Biological Diversity, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as
well as the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their
Disposal, the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and the Minamata Convention on Mercury.
The principles laid down in Bayer’s SCoC comprise an
important component in supplier selection and evaluation. Moreover, we expect our suppliers to replicate
these standards further down the supply chain.
Bayer’s SCoC is therefore made available to our suppliers with the goal of strengthening our mutual understanding of how sustainability should be practiced in
day-to-day business. Bayer’s SCoC is available in 21
languages on our website, which can be accessed
here.

4.2 Procurement Activities

In addition, our comprehensive Supplier Code of Conduct
Guidance aims to provide concrete examples of good practices and benchmarks that suppliers can use, and references such as the regulatory framework and standards governing Bayer’s sustainability efforts.
To effectively address the wide-ranging challenges of a
sustainable supply chain and to leverage synergies, Bayer
is a member of several initiatives including the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) and Together for Sustainability (TfS). These initiatives are integral elements of
Bayer’s commitment to sustainability in the supply chain.
For further details, please refer to chapter 4.3 Sustainability in the Supply Chain.
We are continually streamlining our processes and guidelines
in response to new regulations such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (SCDDA), which require
companies to undergo a due diligence process on human
rights and some environmental standards in the supply chain.

4.2 Procurement Activities
In 2024, we had a total of 87,893 (2023: 85,895) suppliers.
Our procurement spend was €19.8 billion (2023: €22.7 billion).
Procurement spend
Our procurement spend is managed in procurement categories and based on dedicated category strategies. The spend
can be split into direct and indirect materials.
// Direct materials include the categories of active ingredients, raw materials, intermediates, finished products and
seeds.
// Important components of our indirect purchasing portfolio include services for research and development (R&D),
marketing & distribution, and administrative functions,

along with materials required for our technical teams
such as technical, engineering and infrastructural goods
and services.

Bayer purchases locally wherever feasible in order to respond
promptly to the requirements of our sites and simultaneously
strengthen local economies. In 2024, this applied to 83%
(2023: 82%) of our procurement spend at our significant
locations of operation, and to 77% (2023: 77%) of procurement spend worldwide.
We procure various petroleum-based chemicals, but these
account for 19% of our overall procurement volume at most.
Alternative raw materials
Seed is a renewable raw material that is in turn used by our
customers in agriculture to grow plants.
Renewable raw materials for the manufacture of our products account for a minor proportion of our chemical and
pharmaceutical procurement volume. These materials are
primarily used when it makes technical, economic and ecological sense to do so. For more information, please see our
website.

4.2 Procurement Activities

We support value chains with the focus on sustainable production, transparency, traceability and certification. Bayer’s
commitment to net-zero deforestation (please see also
chapter 3. Product Stewardship) includes the ambition to
source sustainable palm (kernel) oil derivatives and soy derivatives. Our activities are aligned with the elements of the
Accountability Framework and cover the products that we
directly purchase. As part of our initial assessment, we have
conducted a risk assessment and due diligence. In our current response to the CDP questionnaire, we have included
further information.
Palm oil

Compared to our overall procurement spend, Bayer only
sources a small number of palm (kernel) oil derivatives for
our businesses (less than 1% of our procurement spend).
A detailed and comprehensive traceability of the origin of
these already processed products is generally not possible.
Bayer has participated in the Roundtable for Sustainable
Palm Oil (RSPO) since 2004. We started to transition our
supply chain to RSPO mass balance certified sustainable
palm oil in 2021. Though there are various challenges, including the availability of products, we aim for at least 90%
of palm oil derivatives purchased by 2027 to be covered
with RSPO mass balance.
Roundtable for Responsible Palm Oil (RSPO)

We support the production of sustainable soy via the purchase of credits certified by the Round Table on Responsible
Soy (RTRS). Bayer has been a member of the RTRS board
since 2017, and 99% of our purchases of soy derivatives are
covered by RTRS credits.
Since 2022, we have also significantly increased our efforts
to gain more insights into the value chain, with the result
that we can trace approximately 80% of our purchases of
soy derivatives to a jurisdictional area.
Suppliers
Conducting business with a diverse supplier portfolio enhances Bayer’s competitive advantage, enabling us to provide innovative and cost-effective products to customers.
When selecting suppliers, we therefore consider all types of
suppliers.

Supplier Diversity Program
Bayer promotes diversity within the global supply
chain by intentionally giving consideration to suppliers
owned and operated by underrepresented groups and
those that might not be noticed if we were not seeking
them out when purchasing goods and services. Underrepresented groups include women, members of
ethnic minorities, people with a disability and members
of the LGBTQ+ community. Together with chambers of
commerce and external organizations, we help these
small and diverse suppliers to advance professionally
and assist them in qualifying for tendering processes.
Bayer has partnered with WEConnect International,
a nongovernmental organization (NGO) that connects
women-owned businesses to buyers around the
world, on co-branded capacity-building programs for
women entrepreneurs – in Mexico in 2022, in Brazil in
2023, and in Germany and Switzerland in 2024 – in
addition to actively participating in other NGO-facilitated capacity-building programs. Since 2022, supplier diversity has been included in our targets for procurement. The procurement spend with certified
women-owned enterprises, specifically, was €73.5 million in 2024.
In 2023, Bayer committed to disability-inclusive procurement by signing up to the Disability:IN Procure
Access initiative that connects companies that recognize the importance of buying and selling technology
that is accessible to people with disabilities. Please
check our website for awards and recognition.

4.3 Sustainability in the Supply Chain

4.3 Sustainability in the Supply
Chain
Clear, sustainability-oriented criteria and standards apply to
our supply chain at both global and regional levels. In 2024,
Procurement defined KPIs that are embedded in the Procurement Scorecard. Following the Diamond Scorecard
Model (4C), it is focused on Cost, Cash, Carbon (Carbon
Budget and Advanced Decarbonization Supplier Spend) and
Community (Supplier Inclusion & Diversity).
Strategic sustainability focus areas
Bayer works continuously to strategically evolve sustainability
topics in procurement, particularly in relation to environmental and human rights issues and in connection with the Supplier Diversity Program. We developed indicators to monitor
progress in various sustainability focus areas (e.g. supplier diversity) and define suitable targets. We also continued to ensure that all suppliers of strategic importance had to present
an EcoVadis rating of at least 45 out of 100 points (“green”
assessment) or a comparable audit result. Furthermore, potential new suppliers with a high inherent sustainability risk
and procurement spend of more than €250,000 are examined in advance regarding sustainability aspects.
The focus in 2024 stayed on developing strategic and operational approaches for ensuring respect for human rights and
the reduction of the carbon footprint in the supply chain.
Human rights in the supply chain

In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on S2 Workers in the Value Chain.
Respect for human rights along the supply chain is firmly
anchored in Bayer’s sustainability strategy, and Procurement
plays a key role in implementing all necessary measures. In
2024, we continued to provide training (e.g. on the subjects
of human trafficking and modern slavery) to our procurement
employees and our suppliers to help them respect human

rights in the supply chain. We sustained our efforts to reinforce our procurement category strategies, embedding responsible purchasing practices among other measures, to
enhance our procurement processes to comply with the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act
(SCDDA).
In the agriculture industry, seed producers are subject to
particular risks, especially as regards respecting human
rights. We continue to implement measures to prevent and
mitigate such risks. In 2025, we plan to continue improving
our procurement processes and take additional measures in
relation to respecting human rights in our supply chain. For
more information, please see chapter 5. Human Rights.
Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

As part of our decarbonization strategy (please see the Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024), we have
committed to achieve a reduction target in accordance with
the requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)
in line with the Paris Agreement. In the future we want to
achieve a 25% reduction in Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2029 (compared to the base year 2019). This updated target for reducing Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions
was validated by the SBTi at the end of 2024. This reduction
will be based on a different number of relevant Scope 3 categories including the upstream and downstream value chain,
thus going beyond the five categories we were using in the last
years. We will publish more details on this over the course of
2025. The majority of Scope 3 emissions fall into category 3.1
Purchased goods and services.
To effectively steer and reduce these emissions, we continue
to drive supply chain decarbonization through our program
(Scope 3 Decarbonization Accelerator), involving experts
from all divisions and relevant Enabling Functions (for more
details, please see the Sustainability Statement in the Annual
Report 2024 E1 Climate Change). With our Scope 3 Decarbonization Accelerator program, we are driving four key

priorities – developing our suppliers on their decarbonization
journey, sourcing from decarbonizing suppliers, improving
our process and reporting capabilities and engaging with
value chain partners. Bayer experts were invited to several
external community events (e.g. Reuters webinar, Climate
Week New York City, Scope 3 peer group, Together for Sustainability [TfS] Talks webinar, Procurement Leaders Sustainability cohort) to share our learnings on our decarbonization
journey. Recognizing our decarbonization efforts, we were
shortlisted for the World Sustainability Leaders in Carbon Reduction category in 2024.
Together with other companies, we cooperated in various
initiatives, such as the Partnership for Carbon Transparency
(PACT) of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) Decarbonization Team and TfS. In this context,
TfS launched SiGREEN in 2024, a Product Carbon Footprint
(PCF) Data Exchange solution to support PCF-related data
exchange across the chemical industry, which can be considered as a crucial tool for decarbonizing this industry. We
also use CDP's supply chain module to evaluate the goals,
strategies and performance of our suppliers. For more information, please see the Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024.
Training for procurement employees
To enable our employees to understand the importance of
sustainability aspects in our supply chain and to effectively
manage our processes, we use dedicated training measures
to instruct our procurement employees in our sustainability
requirements. In 2024, we continued to offer a comprehensive sustainability training package (training programs via the
GoLearn platform) to our procurement employees covering
the focus topics.
After embedding a revised version of Bayer’s Supplier Code of
Conduct in 2022, a web-based training was rolled out in 2023
that focuses on the main principles as well as implementation

and monitoring processes. We also conducted advanced and
in-depth training courses on selected focus topics. Procurement employees take part in EcoVadis webinars, and all Bayer
employees also have free access to the TfS Academy and the
PSCI resource library and the Learnster training platform.
In an open series of dialogues on sustainability topics, we invite our procurement employees to grow their knowledge, ask
questions and interact on topics related to sustainability.
Process to improve sustainability in the supply chain
We have established a four-step process throughout the
Group to improve sustainability practices in the supply chain.
This process is implemented through cross-functional cooperation between the Procurement and Public Affairs,

important suppliers. We leverage formats such as direct
communication or supplier events such as our Supplier Day.
Step 2: Sustainability supplier nomination

Step 1: Sustainability supplier awareness

The core principles of our sustainability requirements are established in Bayer’s Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC),
which is based on our Bayer Human Rights Policy, our Legal, Compliance and Insurance Policy, the principles of the
UN Global Compact and the core labor standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO). The Supplier Code of
Conduct is available in 21 languages and covers the areas
of ethics, relations with employees and other stakeholders
(including human rights), health, safety, environmental protection and quality, and corporate governance and management systems. The Bayer SCoC is frequently reviewed and
updated. It includes the legal requirements of the German
SCDDA. In our SCoC, we state that grievances and (compliance) violations can be reported – anonymously if desired –
via a central, globally available Speak Up Channel set up by
Bayer (for more information, please see chapter 2. Corporate Governance). Additionally, we expect our suppliers to
make an adequate grievance mechanism available to their
stakeholders.
The SCoC is applied in the selection and evaluation of our
suppliers and is integrated into electronic ordering systems
throughout the Bayer Group. Our SCoC is supplemented by
a global guidance document (Supplier Code of Conduct
Guidance), which, like the SCoC, is available on our website.
Furthermore, our standard supply contracts generally contain a clause that authorizes us to verify suppliers’ compliance with our sustainability requirements. This clause has
been integrated into our central contracting and purchase
order systems and is included in contracts.
Bayer also takes a proactive approach in raising awareness
of sustainability expectations toward our strategically

All strategically important suppliers and all suppliers identified with a high sustainability risk are required to undergo a
sustainability evaluation.
Bayer partners with Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) to
draw up a detailed sustainability risk framework based on internationally recognized sources such as the World Bank and
the United Nations. We updated the risk framework in 2024,
which focuses on a supplier’s sector of activity (category risk)
and the country sustainability risk. Both risk factors are based
on different risk dimensions, such as the environment (e.g. climate and energy), social standards (e.g. risk of child labor,
abuse by security forces, living wage & living income) and corporate governance (e.g. data privacy risk). The combination of
category and country risk, combined with the threshold of an
annual spend of €500,000, enables identification of Bayer’s
high sustainability risk suppliers.
Bayer examines the suppliers identified in these two steps in
order to request a sustainability assessment. In 2024, this
process included 157 strategically important suppliers, making up around 33% of the total spend, and 326 suppliers
with a high sustainability risk and a significant procurement
spend (>€0.5 million p.a.) of nearly 11% of the total spend.
Furthermore, suppliers can be nominated for a sustainability
evaluation by different functions, business areas or category
managers, e.g. in the case of newly planned business cooperations, insufficient in-depth knowledge or outdated supplier data.
Also included in the nomination are selected suppliers from
the sustainability development process (see Step 4) and
suppliers for which evaluations were performed according to
the TfS and the PSCI audit frameworks.

4.3 Sustainability in the Supply Chain

Step 3: Sustainability supplier performance evaluation

Bayer verifies the observance of the code requirements by
the suppliers selected in Step 2 by means of EcoVadis online
assessments and through audits conducted by both external
and Bayer auditors. EcoVadis monitors sustainability in global
supply chains through an online assessment. Using technology and sustainability expertise, EcoVadis engages with
companies and helps them adopt sustainable practices.
The online assessment criteria of EcoVadis – broken down
into the areas of environment, ethics, labor and human rights,
and sustainable procurement – correspond to the requirements of our SCoC, and also consider country- and industryspecific conditions and supplier size. In total, our service provider EcoVadis assessed 1,324 (1,118 in 2023) suppliers on
our behalf in 2024.

We use the specialized methodologies of EcoVadis, TfS and
PSCI to assess the sustainability of companies. However,
the seed supply chain is structured differently, which is why
these approaches cannot currently be implemented in the
same way by agricultural businesses. Suppliers in the seeds
segment have a particular risk of human rights violations.
Therefore, prevention and mitigation measures have been
developed within the seed supply chain, which are explained
in chapter 5. Human Rights.
In 2024, more than 55% of our purchasing volume (€11 billion) was attributable to suppliers with a sustainability rating
(EcoVadis) or subject to a sustainability audit (TfS or PSCI).

Bayer itself conducts EcoVadis assessments annually. In 2024,
we updated our EcoVadis assessment, scoring 75 out of 100.
We therefore belong to the top 2% of companies rated by
EcoVadis in the industry group for manufacturers of basic
pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations.
In 2024, 131 audits were conducted at our suppliers by external or internal auditors. The audit criteria included both
the specifications of our Supplier Code of Conduct and the
industry-specific requirements of industry initiatives such as
TfS and PSCI. These audits provide the opportunity for further standardization of the sustainability requirements that
suppliers in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries are
expected to meet. The sharing and mutual recognition of
assessment and audit results also create synergies between the members of the respective initiatives.

Bayer’s HSE audit activities also contribute to our overall responsibility for a sustainable supply chain. HSE and sustainability audits complement each other, forming an efficient
evaluation approach, depending on the individual risks. The
results of all audits are factored into the supplier selection and
management processes. In 2024, 339 (2023: 363) supplier
audits were conducted, either as HSE audits or audits covering HSE topics (such as sustainability audits). For further details, please also see chapter 8. Health and Safety).

4.3 Sustainability in the Supply Chain

Analyzing the EcoVadis assessments of our suppliers in
2024, the greatest need for improvement continued to be in
the categories of ethics and sustainable procurement. For
audited suppliers, most gaps were identified in the areas of
health and safety and labor. Bayer provides relevant capability-building training to the suppliers. The main sources for
training are the platforms from PSCI and TfS.
In addition, we have established verification processes for
the fulfillment of further international regulations such as
those requesting companies to disclose the origin of certain
raw materials. This also applies to conflict minerals. When
surveying our relevant suppliers, we use the internationally
recognized Conflict Minerals Reporting Template to identify
the use, sources and origin of certain minerals in our supply
chain. In our SCoC, we make clear that our suppliers have
to ensure that products they supply to Bayer do not contain
metals derived from minerals or their derivatives that originate from conflict regions in which the procurement of these
could help – directly or indirectly – to finance or support
armed groups and cause or foster human rights abuses.
Suppliers who do not meet these requirements are immediately notified that these standards must be complied with
and are requested to take corresponding action.
Step 4: Sustainability supplier development

Evaluated suppliers identified in the nomination step (Step 2)
receive a corrective action plan based on their sustainability
performance and are requested to verify their performance
improvement via a re-evaluation after a reasonable period.
Additionally, we focus on improving suppliers that have a
poor sustainability performance, and we established a new
supplier sustainability development approach in 2023 that
was continued in 2024. Suppliers are included in the development process based on their sustainability performance,
their strategic importance for Bayer and their sustainability
risk. The evaluation results are analyzed, specific improvement measures are jointly defined with the supplier, and

these are documented in an action plan. Bayer supports
suppliers with capability-building activities and a monitoring
process. The development cycle is rounded off by a re-evaluation to verify the implementation of improvements. Bayer
retains the right to terminate a supplier relationship if no improvement is observed during a re-evaluation.
In 2024, 122 suppliers were added to the development process. Some 34 suppliers have already completed the development and conducted a re-evaluation with a 97% rate of
successful improvement. Some of the suppliers showed minor improvements and will continue the development cycle
to achieve better performance in the future.
If critical results are recorded as a result of a serious violation or several major shortcomings are identified during a
supplier’s sustainability performance evaluation, specific
improvement measures are then jointly defined. In 2024,
critical results were determined for 12 suppliers (less than
1% of all assessed and audited suppliers). In these cases,
we request that the suppliers remedy the identified

weaknesses. We monitor the implementation of these activities through re-assessments or follow-up audits. In 2024,
we were not prompted to end any supplier relationship
solely due to sustainability performance.
In total, 858 (2023: 687) of the 1,455 (2023: 1,252) suppliers
assessed via EcoVadis or audited via TfS or PSCI improved
their sustainability performance in 2024.
Additionally, we established a development program for suppliers in the Conflict Minerals Verification Process in 2024. Our
objective is to achieve a conflict-minerals-free supply chain.
For this we have engaged and trained seven suppliers and are
tracking improvements in their usage of metals originating from
conflict regions. These are long-term efforts as the engagement goes far beyond our direct suppliers and we will continue
the engagement throughout the upcoming years.
In 2024, a successful virtual supplier day, the Igniting Networks Live, was organized, highlighting Bayer’s commitment
to sustainability and Bayer’s expectation of suppliers. The

event also served to maintain effective collaboration and
communication, foster long-term partnerships with suppliers
to drive continuous improvement, enhance suppliers’ sustainability performance and achieve strategic goals. Additionally, we organized webinars on key topics for suppliers,
such as a global decarbonization webinar and a Chinese
supplier decarbonization webinar.
External partnerships
Bayer is a member of several industry initiatives of which the
two most important are the PSCI and TfS. Both initiatives
are integral elements of Bayer’s commitment to sustainability
in the supply chain, providing sustainability-oriented upskilling training for suppliers and supplier managers.
TfS is an initiative of chemical companies committed to
making sustainability improvements within their own – and
their suppliers’ – operations. This is designed to build global
standards for the environmental, social and governance performance of chemical supply chains. TfS members are
chemical companies that represented a global annual turnover of over €800 billion and a global spend of more than
€500 billion in the chemical industry in 2023.
The TfS Academy is a practical-oriented learning environment
for suppliers and Bayer procurement employees. It covers
topics such as ethical aspects, conflict minerals, waste management and anti-corruption measures. In 2024, Bayer selected around 160 suppliers to participate in TfS training
courses based on their sustainability performance and Bayer’s
assessment plan. The training courses dealt with labor and
human rights guidelines, whistleblower procedures, environmental reporting and sustainable procurement guidelines.

Responsible Supply Chain Management as a blueprint for
responsible practice.
The PSCI organized more than 50 training sessions and
webinars for suppliers on various human rights, ethics and
HSE topics in 2024. A global supplier conference and two
face-to-face supplier capability-building conferences in
China and India took place in 2024. These conferences were
attended by more than 1,100 supplier representatives.
Through the PSCI online resource library, our suppliers can
use additional training materials, which are supplemented
every year.
Besides the information provided in the PSCI resource library and in webinars, training courses on Human Rights,
Ethics as well as Health, Safety and Environmental are provided on the e-learning platform Learnster, which allows organizations to create their own interactive and engaging
courses. Via Learnster, both PSCI members and their suppliers have access to the PSCI catalogue of courses and can
track progress against the PSCI maturity framework.
Bayer is also a member of the Sustainability Procurement
Pledge’s (SPP) League of Champions, which provides access to a wide range of capability-building resources and
engagement opportunities – developed for Procurement, by
Procurement – across all regions, sectors and issues. SPP is
an international organization for procurement professionals,
academics and practitioners, driving awareness and
knowledge about responsible sourcing practices and empowering people working in procurement.

The purpose of the PSCI is to define, establish and promote
responsible supply chain practices, human rights, environmental sustainability and responsible business along the
pharmaceutical supply chain, using the PSCI Principles for

5.1 Management Approach

5. Human Rights
Bayer is a founding member of the UN Global Compact and
respects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of the United Nations.
Our human rights due diligence is based on the related principles described in the UN Guiding Principles on Business
and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises. The UNGPs are considered to be
among the most important international standards for preventing and combating possible human rights violations in
connection with business activities. We are engaged in meeting this responsibility along the entire value chain and within
our scope of influence worldwide. We also support the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the latter’s core labor standards.

5.1 Management Approach
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on S1 Own Workforce, S2 Workers in the Value
Chain, S3 Affected Communities and S4 Consumers and
End-Users.
Human rights are among the responsibilities of the Chairman
of the Board of Management (CEO). In his role as Chief Sustainability Officer, he is supported in the topic of human
rights by the Public Affairs, Sustainability & Safety (PASS)
Enabling Function. Bayer also has a Human Rights Officer
who oversees risk management in regard to human rights
and reports to the Board of Management about their work.
The implementation of our human rights standards in business operations is regulated by Group regulations, processes, and management and monitoring systems.

Bayer is fully committed to upholding human rights and has
documented its stance in a globally binding Bayer Human
Rights Policy, which defines the human rights requirements
within the company and obligates us to respect and foster
human rights within our own business activities and in business relations. This policy was adopted by the Board of
Management and is publicly available on the company’s
website. It applies to all Bayer employees worldwide and the
entire value chain, i.e. vis-à-vis suppliers, business partners,
customers, consumers and local communities alike. In accordance with international human rights standards, we are
always mindful to respect the rights of disadvantaged or vulnerable groups throughout our value chain – from indigenous peoples to individuals and groups who can benefit
from Bayer’s innovations.
Guided by our Code of Conduct and supplementary to our
Human Rights Policy, we substantiate specific standards
and responsibilities for respecting human rights in existing
rules and Group regulations. These include regulations on
data privacy, fairness & respect at work, “HSE Management
and HSE Key Requirements”, security and crisis management. Our Supplier Code of Conduct specifies what we expect of our suppliers and obligates them to fully respect human rights. The Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the
principles of the UN Global Compact and the core labor
standards of the ILO.
We have put in place management systems to meet our
product stewardship responsibility with regard to human
rights, too. For us, product stewardship means that our
products meet the highest quality standards and that neither
their development and manufacture nor their disposal should
cause damage to people or the environment. For more information, please see chapter 3. Product Stewardship.

As a central element of Bayer’s corporate strategy, “SDG 5
Gender equality” is anchored in our work on behalf of inclusion and diversity. For more information on the topic of
women’s empowerment and gender balance and our targets
for our own business activities, please see chapter 6. Employees. For more information on how we perform due diligence with respect to human rights within our own workforce, please see also chapters 6. Employees and 8. Health
and Safety.

5.2 Implementing Human Rights
Due Diligence
We implement measures to respect human rights both
within our own company and along our entire value chain.
Group regulations and processes, as well as management
and monitoring systems, govern the implementation of human
rights standards.
We are aware that the implementation of human rights due
diligence is a continuous process that must be constantly
adapted and improved. To ensure respect for human rights
in the value chain in a targeted manner, Bayer operates according to a due diligence approach that is based on the
UNGPs and OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.
Guided by our human rights strategy and Group-wide management systems, our due diligence process comprises a
policy statement, risk identification and assessment processes, prevention and mitigation measures, the implementation of remedial measures, and measures for determining
effectiveness and reporting, along with access to grievance
mechanisms.

Human rights strategy
By 2030, we want to be industry-leading in our approach to
human rights, based on our human rights strategy, which
comprises three interlinking phases:
1. Definition of the framework: derivation of the human
rights strategy based on an analysis of the status and
risks in accordance with the UNGPs and OECD Guidelines, our mission “Health for all, Hunger for none” and
the legal requirements such as those stemming from the
German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (SCDDA)
2. Operationalization and full integration: expansion of
existing due diligence processes to address human rights
risks

For more information on the ESG Committee and the Sustainability Council, please see chapter 2. Corporate Governance.
Policy statement
Our commitment to human rights is documented in a globally
binding Group regulation, the Bayer Human Rights Policy. This
commitment includes internationally recognized human rights
in accordance with the International Bill of Human Rights and
the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work
of the ILO. This commitment was directly approved by the
Board of Management and is available on our website.
This Group regulation is regularly reviewed and updated as
needed. In 2024, the policy was updated to reflect organizational changes and continues to include all obligations stemming from the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. The
updated Human Rights Policy took immediate effect for all
Bayer employees in April 2024. It applies both internally and
when dealing with external business partners of Bayer, (direct and indirect) suppliers, contractors, customers,

consumers, members of local communities and government
officials. In addition to the German and English version, it
was translated into Chinese, French, Italian, Japanese,
Spanish, Portuguese and Russian.
New employees are made aware of Bayer’s human rights
obligations during their onboarding activities.
Reporting
We regularly inform the public in this annually published Impact
Report about our strategy, approaches and results in connection with human rights due diligence. Furthermore, we report
explicitly on our measures to combat modern slavery in our
annually updated Modern Slavery Statement. In 2024, we published the first report under the SCDDA and are publishing the
first Sustainability Statement under the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in 2025 as part of our 2024
Annual Report.
Risk identification and assessment
We use a risk analysis to identify potentially adverse impacts
of our business activity on human rights. In doing so, human
rights risks are identified, evaluated and prioritized, from an
overarching risk analysis for the entire company to detailed
analyses in selected areas. Our risk analysis is aligned to the
Chemie3 industry standard:
Levels of Risk Analysis according to Chemie³ Industry Standard
Overarching

The issue of human rights is among the responsibilities of
the Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO), who
consults regularly with the Human Rights Officer. In 2024,
the Board of Management was briefed three times by the
Human Rights Officer on the officer’s work and developments in this regard.

The analyses are conducted at least once per year and on
an ad hoc basis. The results of this human rights risk analysis are communicated to relevant internal decision-makers
and incorporated into the Bayer risk portfolio of our Groupwide, integrated risk management system in cases where
the threshold values are exceeded. There, decisions on risk
mitigation measures are also documented. The risk portfolio
is regularly reviewed by the Bayer Assurance Committee,
please see chapter 2. Corporate Governance.
We have identified six priority issues:
//
//
//
//
//
//

Right to health
Responsible use of natural resources
Protection against child labor
Right to freedom from slavery, servitude and forced labor
Right to fair and favorable working conditions
Right to freedom of association

Risks are identified and assessed at a superordinate level in
a two-step process:
// The first step is to identify potential human rights risks
that we could encounter, either through our business activities, products and services or in our value chain.
// The second step is to assess these rights separately in
terms of their risks with regard to their degree of
severity (based on their scale, scope and irremediability),
materiality and likelihood of occurrence.

Salience and materiality
Two dimensions must be accounted for when
managing human rights risks:
// The first comprises salient human rights issues,
which refer to those human rights that can be

most severely impacted by our activities and
business relationships.
// The other concerns material human rights,
which are those that are of great importance
for our internal and external stakeholders.

In assessing human rights-related risks, we distinguish between gross and net risks. The gross risk refers to a risk a
company can expect due to its business operations, the
type and scope of its products and services along the value
chain, excluding any governance measures (in other words,
prevention and mitigation measures). The net risk describes
the gross risk, taking account of prevention/mitigation
measures that have already been established.
First, we assessed the respective gross risk and then the net
risk, taking into account established prevention and mitigation measures.
This enabled us to identify and assess the human rights that
could be negatively impacted most significantly through our
activities and business relationships in the upstream and
downstream value chains (salient human rights) or that are
of particular importance for our company (material human
rights).
For more information on the detailed risk analyses, please
see chapters 4. Procurement, 6. Employees, 8. Environmental Protection and 9. Health and Safety.
Prevention/mitigation and remedial measures
We offer numerous ongoing training programs to enhance
employees’ awareness of the importance of human rights in
their day-to-day activities and outside the organization. This
includes a basic training course entitled “Respecting Human
Rights at Bayer” to further anchor awareness about, and

respect for, human rights throughout the Bayer Group. The
training course is available to employees in nine languages
(English, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish).
In 2024, more than 74% of our employees received training
on aspects of our Human Rights Policy in sessions totaling
more than 144,000 hours. The topic of human rights is an
integral element of training measures for the management
teams of our country organizations.
In 2024, we conducted two learning sessions with an internationally renowned human rights expert along with our own
internal expert about human rights in order to engage in a
meaningful discussion with the interested employees who
joined the session. The focus was on how effective human
rights management is globally supported by national and international policies that are aimed at preventing human
rights violations, and on the importance of companies making continuous efforts to respond to findings and to continuously improve their human rights management.
We continue to be members of the Together for Sustainability (TfS) industry initiative and the Pharmaceutical Supply
Chain Initiative (PSCI) to successfully meet the wide-ranging
challenges of a sustainable supply chain and work out synergies. This involves conducting audits and assessments
and offering further education activities such as training and
conferences.
We verify the observance of human rights at our sites partly
by means of Bayer audits. Bayer Internal Audit regularly conducts audits following the standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). The annual audit planning follows a riskbased approach. These audits include a verification of our
human resources processes, particularly concerning labor
contracts, compliance with hiring requirements (including a
minimum age verification) of our permanent and temporary
employees, and employees’ working hours. Internal Audit

also examines whether employees are paid a living wage.
Our procurement processes are audited as well, for example
the commissioning of contractors. A total of 73 audit reports
were compiled in 2024, of which ten were preventive compliance program audits or incident-related investigations.
If we determine that a human rights violation has occurred or
is imminent within our own business activities or those of a
supplier, we immediately take appropriate remedial measures
to prevent or stop them or to minimize their scope.
We report in detail on human rights due diligence for our
workforce and the local communities in the relevant chapters 3. Product Stewardship, 5.3 Respect for Human Rights
in the Supply Chain, 6. Employees, 8. Environmental Protection and 9. Health and Safety.
Effectiveness review
We continue to develop the concept and individual measurement systems, taking into account established measurement
systems, such as supply chain monitoring, social impact
measurement for our smallholder projects or the safety culture program.
For more information, please see the Sustainability Strategy
chapter, chapters 4. Procurement and 9. Health and Safety.
Grievance mechanisms
If there are indications of violations of our Human Rights
Policy, employees and members of the general public can
contact the worldwide Speak Up Channel, which is operated
by an independent, external provider. Reports can be filed by
anyone either via webpage, Speak Up App or through a
phone call made in the caller’s preferred language. This can
also be done anonymously, if desired. Alternatively, employees can also report suspected violations to the respective
compliance functions or to the Internal Audit unit or submit
information via an internal company email address (known
as the Speak-Up Inbox) or in the form of an incident request

via a platform (also anonymously if desired and if permitted
by respective national law).
The compliance function records and processes all compliance violations. This enables us to systematically register,
track and sanction various types of human rights violations.
The action taken depends on factors including the gravity of
the violation and applicable law. All cases are recorded according to uniform criteria throughout the Bayer Group and
dealt with under the rules set forth in Bayer’s Group Regulation on Legal, Compliance & Insurance.
For more information on compliance management at Bayer,
please see chapter 2. Corporate Governance.

5.3 Respect for Human Rights in
the Supply Chain
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on S2 Workers in the Value Chain.
Regarding the topic of human rights, we are focusing particularly on our supply chain as this connects us with several
million rights holders – in other words, people who are directly or indirectly impacted by our activities. For this purpose, Bayer Procurement undertakes a classification of the
sustainability risk of our suppliers. This risk classification encompasses all procurement countries and categories such
as services and seed production, the latter also including
seasonal workers. This enables us to identify and systematically address human rights risks by country and category.
Aspects of human rights (e.g. human trafficking, modern
slavery and freedom of association) are also covered in the
training offerings in connection with the Bayer Supplier Code
of Conduct Guidance document, which supplements our
Supplier Code of Conduct and supports suppliers in implementing the requirements of the code.

Furthermore, we verify the observance of human rights by
our suppliers, partly by means of on-site audits that include
interviews with the suppliers’ management and employees.
In 2024, we actively worked together with suppliers in
whose operations we had identified critical findings regarding human rights in the previous year. Where necessary, the
suppliers were included in our Sustainability Supplier Development Program, follow-up audits were conducted in 2024
or further audits are planned. In this way, we attempt to improve the situation for suppliers’ employees not just in the
short term, but also in the long term. In 2024, audits of
suppliers uncovered a very small number of critical findings
regarding applicable wages, employee benefits, working
hours, health and safety. In each of these cases, we also
actively cooperated with our suppliers by agreeing on a
time-bound corrective action plan to improve the situation
for employees in a timely fashion. In 2023, we piloted a
supplier questionnaire containing sustainability-related
questions to identify the supplier in question’s engagement
and performance as part of our procurement activities
where no supplier sustainability assessment was available.
The focus in 2024 was on developing strategic and operational approaches for respecting human rights in the supply
chain. For more information, please see chapter 4. Procurement.
Challenges in the seed supply chain
In general, the risk of human rights violations is a fundamental risk in seed supply chains and therefore also generally a risk for Bayer. In 2024, we again dealt in detail with
human rights risks along our global seed supply chain and
continued our risk prevention and mitigation measures. The
risk of human rights violations in the seed supply chain is
potentially higher in the following countries in which we are
active:

Measures undertaken to mitigate risks included Bayer’s
Child Care Program to identify and prohibit child labor.
Tackling child labor in the seed supply chain
Bayer works to prevent child labor through the Child Care
Program. The program is established in India, Bangladesh,
the Philippines and Thailand.
Through our Child Care Program, we continuously raise
awareness among our suppliers about the problem of child
labor and clearly communicate our requirements, because
our position on child labor is unambiguous: it is strictly prohibited at Bayer. We therefore oblige our suppliers to refrain
from illegally employing children.
The goal of the Child Care Program is to take action
against child labor in the seed supply chain. It therefore
involves systematic and repeated inspections of individual
seed producers in their fields by local Bayer employees
during the growing season. Furthermore, a pilot of the program was run in Indonesia during the 2024/2025 growing
season to find out how high the risk of child labor among
local seed producers actually is. So far, we have not uncovered any concrete indications of child labor cases
among our seed producers in that country.

Through the Child Care Program, we also conduct activities
outside the growing season to prevent child labor. In the off
season, Bayer employees visit schools to underscore the
importance of a good education to schoolchildren and their
teachers. Accompanied by medical personnel, they also
emphasize the importance of good hygiene.
Graduated sanctions are applied to our suppliers for noncompliance with our prohibition on child labor. These range
from written warnings to termination of the contract in the
case of repeated noncompliance. Thanks to a stringent
monitoring system and the support of local information and
educational initiatives, no cases of child labor have been
identified in India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, the Philippines or
Thailand to date since the 2021/22 growing season.
Extraction of raw materials
Our upstream, indirect supply chain includes certain raw
materials whose extraction poses a heightened risk of human rights violations. This applies to the supply chains of
minerals, as well as palm and soybean oil and their derivatives. In addition to our clear expectation that our suppliers
also implement the principles defined in our Supplier Code
of Conduct in the upstream supply chain, we have established further measures to respect human rights.
Bayer’s net-zero deforestation target and its commitment to
respecting human rights throughout the supply chain also include the objective of sourcing sustainable palm (kernel) oil
and sustainable soybean derivatives. For more information,
please see chapter 4. Procurement.
Bayer strives for more sustainable value chains focused on
more sustainable production, transparency, traceability and
certification. Our activities are aligned with the elements of
the Accountability Framework. We work with our partners
and suppliers to further reduce our ecological footprint and
to establish social and ethical standards.

We continue to advocate for the responsible procurement of
conflict materials. As the procurement of minerals originating
in unstable regions of the world can contribute to the financing of conflicts and the violation of human rights, our Supplier Code of Conduct communicates our explicit expectation that our suppliers ensure products supplied to Bayer do
not contain metals derived from raw materials originating
from conflict regions that directly or indirectly help to finance
or support armed groups and cause or foster human rights
abuses.

5.4 Stakeholder Engagement and
Partnerships
We find it very important to consider the interests of people
potentially impacted by our activities. Therefore, we also coordinate our human rights due diligence approach with
Bayer’s German and European works council as well as with
various elected employee representatives.
We want to perform our due diligence for constructive
stakeholder involvement and are working on a concept
based on practical experience that incorporates the interests
of affected parties.

Local Stakeholder Engagement 2023/2024 in Peru
We initiated local stakeholder engagement at our production site in Peru last year in response to concerns
raised about working conditions. During an initial onsite visit in December 2023, which included regional

employees to strengthen the accessibility of our grievance channels, and strengthening engagement with
external stakeholders.
In 2024, we continued our efforts with additional listening and training sessions, a review of the accessibility of our grievance mechanism, and multiple interactions with local stakeholders. We have reinforced
our stakeholder engagement on site by fostering close
communication and dialogue with the local trade union, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other
institutions such as the local Chamber of Commerce.
This approach aims to strengthen relationships and
collaboratively expand our local initiatives.

Dialogue with stakeholders
We regularly engage in dialogue with stakeholders on the
topic of human rights and actively participate in committees
and initiatives established to ensure their observance. We do
this, for example, in the corresponding working groups of
econsense, where we have overseen the themes of human
rights and industry since 2022, and participate in the Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) initiative. The member
companies from various industries discuss best practices,
challenges and experiences in implementing human rights
and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights (UNGPs).

In June 2024, Bayer had the opportunity to send a delegate
to the 112th International Labor Conference of the International Labour Organization (ILO) to represent both the technical and practical corporate perspective in the development
of the first Biological Hazard standard.
Nurturing partnerships
Continuously raising awareness about child labor in the agriculture sector requires extensive measures and the involvement of various stakeholders. Against this background,
Bayer joined with other seed companies back in 2019 to establish the Enabling Child and Human Rights with Seed Organizations (ECHO) initiative. ECHO is one of the biggest
multi-stakeholder forums for the promotion of children’s
rights and decent work – which includes fair wages, as well
as healthy and safe working conditions. In 2024, ECHO organized a walkathon to mark the World Day Against Child
Labor with the goal of raising awareness about the issue.

Bayer is also an active participant in the discussion on due
diligence with respect to human rights at the EU level and
on the implementation of the requirements stemming from
the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (SCDDA) at the
national level.

6.1 Management Approach

6. Employees
Bayer’s success is essentially built on the knowledge and
commitment of its employees. At Bayer, employees can positively change the world through their work, in addition to developing themselves further. We want our company to be
characterized by inclusion and diversity and to enable people
of different backgrounds and skills to generate added value
for our world. We offer attractive conditions and wide-ranging individual development opportunities for all employees,
and bear responsibility all around the world.
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on S1 Own Workforce.

6.1 Management Approach
Human Resources (HR) at Bayer assumes leadership of
the HR organization and is responsible for the Group-wide
regulations and standards for our employees. HR is headed
directly by a member of the Board of Management, the Chief
Talent Officer, who also assumes the function of Labor Director. HR is responsible for the operational design, implementation and steering of the global HR processes with the goal of
accelerating the development and impact of our talent.
Corporate culture
The company aims to create a culture that is based on fairness and respect for all. As established in the Bayer Human
Rights Policy, we are committed to respecting the human
rights of our employees and therefore to fair and equal treatment as a basic principle of our work environment. This includes observing Group-wide standards of conduct and protecting employees from discrimination, harassment and
retaliation. These standards are set out in our Code of Conduct, which was signed by the Board of Management. Bayer

employees around the world are provided with guidance on
how to comply with these standards.
Numerous external awards and surveys bear witness to our
excellent reputation as an employer. In 2024, these included
the Top Employer certification for Europe for the first time,
with Bayer receiving recognition across Germany, the BeNeLux region, Spain and Portugal. Furthermore, Bayer continues to be one of the best employers in Germany, China, the
United States and Brazil. More than half of the Bayer workforce is employed in these four countries.
In Africa, Bayer was recognized as a Top Employer in both
Kenya and South Africa by the Top Employers Institute. We
excelled in key evaluation areas, including Leadership Strategy, Organizational Change and Digital Human Resources,
as well as with our employer branding and diversity initiatives. These recognitions underscore Bayer's dedication to
high standards in human resources and our continued investment in employee support and development.

consistently high scores on the Disability Equality Index as a
Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion since 2019. Bayer
also earned the 2024 Military Friendly Employer designation,
supporting veterans in transitioning to the workforce.
Digitalization
We see digitalization as a major opportunity for Bayer. In accordance with the applicable laws, robotic process automation and artificial intelligence are deployed in various HR processes in order to simplify them and increase efficiency.
They also help improve user experience and reduce costs
and manual activities. The company provides special training
in the area of digitalization such as on how to use a Bayer
internal chatbot.

In India, Bayer has consistently been acknowledged for its
workplace culture, especially within the chemical industry
sector. We were recognized among India’s Best Workplaces
in Chemicals in 2024, emphasizing our commitment to
health, safety and a collaborative work environment in the
region.
In 2024, Bayer received multiple recognitions across various
countries for our workplace environment and commitment
to employee well-being. In the United States, Bayer was
honored by Newsweek as one of America’s Greatest Workplaces for Diversity, showcasing our dedication to creating
an inclusive and diverse workplace. Additionally, Bayer's
commitment to accessibility and inclusion is reflected in our

In Germany, the General Works Agreements on lifetime
working and demographic change and on addressing demographic change at the nonmanagerial level at Bayer are
among the tools we use to help shape the working environment for all life phases. These General Works Agreements
provide for a reduction in employee workloads that was extended to further age groups, as well as measures to ease
the return to work of non-managerial employees after longterm illness, and an extensive health screening program for
all employees. In 2024, 99% of those who were eligible took
part in the program to reduce the workload of older employees. What’s more, the BayZeit long-term account makes it
possible for employees in Germany to convert part of their
gross salary in the early years of their employment into free
time that they can take off later.

Talent acquisition
We pursue the overarching objective of attracting qualified
employees and retaining them over the long term. In accordance with our Human Resources (HR) strategy, we ensure
that new employees are well integrated into the company
culture and manage talent acquisition through a continuous
process. In line with our Group Regulation on Talent Attraction, the Human Resources function has provided mandatory guidelines for the process worldwide, which have been
signed by the Board of Management.
To acquire and retain talent, we focus heavily on social media and our global careers page. Country-specific acquisition and awareness campaigns enable local configurations
as well the measurement of how many talented candidates
were reached and hired. We use our Talent Marketplace to
match talented candidates with vacant positions based on
their skills and experience, as well as to streamline the internal pre-selection process and reduce bias. The deployed
technology was subjected to a thorough ethical examination.
In total, the Bayer Group hired 6,241 new employees in
2024, accounting for 6.8% of the workforce.

Bayer uses temporary employees from staffing agencies
primarily in response to short-term personnel requirements,
fluctuations in order levels, for temporary projects or as replacements for employees suffering a long-term illness.
In some countries, staff are employed via agencies for seasonal work. On December 31, 2024, some 3,848 temporary
employees from staffing agencies were working for Bayer at
our significant locations of operation. In Germany, the proportion of such temporary employees from staffing agencies
compared with the total for the core workforce was 0.6%.

People with disabilities are an integral part of our workforce.
Based on voluntary statements by employees, we employ
around 2,128 people with disabilities in 43 countries, 45% of
whom are women and 55% men. That represents 2.6% of
our workforce in countries where self-declaration is possible.
Most employees with disabilities work in Germany, where
they made up 4.4% of the workforce in 2024.

We employ people from 145 nations. The voluntary self-declaration of ethnic background is currently available in a selected number of countries. Of our employees in Brazil, 27%
are Black, 3% are Asian and 1% of other ethnic origin. Of our
employees in South Africa, 37% are Black, 6% are Asian and
4% are Colored (multi-ethnic). In the United States (incl. Puerto
Rico), the workforce includes 13% Asian, 5% Black or African
descent, 11% Hispanic or Latino and 3% other ethnic origin.

Restructuring measures
We act with social responsibility when changes and restructuring measures are necessary. In all countries, we aim to
minimize the impact on employees and find mutually agreeable solutions in cases where job reductions are necessary.
This is also the case in Germany, where agreements are in
place with employee representatives that fundamentally rule
out dismissals for operational reasons in the intercompany
personnel network of Bayer AG until the end of 2026. We are
at different stages of development regarding the acceleration
of our transformation announced in 2020. We anticipate that
all the major transformation measures announced in 2020 will
be implemented by the end of this year. Flexible models with
attractive conditions are offered to employees of various age
groups. Employees can also receive counseling on career reorientation and are supported through job application training
measures.

Introduction of a new organizational model
We are currently working on better familiarizing our organization with the mission of “Health for all, Hunger for none,”
and are therefore introducing a new system called Dynamic
Shared Ownership (DSO). This new organizational model is
more closely aligned to customer needs and empowers our
teams to more effectively satisfy these needs and deploy our
resources more efficiently in the future.
Our goal is for employees to work in small, self-administered
teams. Activities are prioritized according to their contribution to fulfilling our mission, and their progress is measured
in short 90-day cycles, which greatly increases our speed of
action. This enables the number of coordination tasks and
management levels to be reduced.
Fair Compensation
Bayer applies uniform standards to ensure that employees
are fairly compensated throughout the Group. Our performance and responsibility-related compensation system
combines a basic salary with performance-related elements,
plus additional benefits. Adjustments based on continuous
benchmarking make our compensation internationally competitive.
At Bayer, individual salaries are based on personal and professional abilities and the level of responsibility assigned,
among other factors. One critical basis for this is a job evaluation independent of the individual. At managerial level, this
is based on a uniform evaluation approach for all positions
throughout the Group using the internationally recognized
Korn Ferry method. Differences in pay based on gender are
ruled out in areas of the Bayer Group and jobs covered by a
binding collective bargaining agreement. In the emerging
markets and developing countries, we exceed local market
conditions with regard to compensation levels and pay at
least a living wage.

In the majority of cases, full- and part-time employees at our
significant locations of operation receive the same rates of fixed
and variable pay. Our compensation concept also includes variable one-time payments to recognize outstanding performance.
In many countries, employee stock programs enable the purchase of Bayer shares at a discount. Depending on statutory
requirements, employees on temporary contracts may not be
entitled to long-term compensation components such as pension plans in some countries. The long-term variable compensation (LTI) of our LTI-entitled managerial employees takes into
account progress toward the Group’s sustainability targets.
Gender pay equity is one of the key pillars of the global inclusion and diversity strategy at Bayer. One key supporting initiative is the Group-wide measurement and analysis of the
“unadjusted” and “adjusted” gender pay gap.
The average global unadjusted gender pay gap was 3.46%
in 2024 and was calculated according to the ESRS requirements. Further information on our approach to adequate
wages can be found in the Sustainability Statement in the
Annual Report 2024, S1 Own workforce. We endeavor to
achieve a Group-wide unadjusted gender pay gap of below
2% by 2030.
In addition, Bayer also reviews individual and collective employee compensation to identify any “adjusted gender pay
gaps” using a machine-learning-based algorithmic methodology. Currently participating in this calculation are 22 Bayer
country organizations that together account for 86% of the
total workforce. The implementation status and associated
measures are monitored using a central dashboard.
Further information on our approach to fair compensation
can be found in the Sustainability Statement in the Annual
Report 2024.

Retirement benefits
In addition to providing attractive compensation for their
work, Bayer contributes to the financial security of its current and former employees. Retirement benefit plans are
available to 84% (2023: 79%, 2022: 79%) of Bayer employees worldwide including statutory pension programs. The
benefits provided depend on the legal, fiscal and economic
conditions in each country, employee compensation and individual years of service.

of lifelong learning. We view it as a central task to offer our
employees a broad range of continuing education options
for their development.
We provide access to high-quality learning and training opportunities that not only promote employees’ career advancement, but also contribute to their personal development. We create a strong team by actively involving our
employees in the development of their skills, knowledge and
abilities.

// “Evaluation of training” describes all forms of evaluation
options. It serves to evaluate existing training offerings
with the goal of providing content for identifying training
needs to initiate a new learning life cycle.
The global training process is supported by two complementary systems – our learning management system and
the learning experience platform. The learning management
system is used for compulsory and GxP-relevant training
courses, formal and internal learning content, tracking course
completion, and the provision and assignment of training offerings. The learning experience platform enables access to
various content providers and wide-ranging offerings, e.g.
LinkedIn Learning: Bayer-internal content curation with more
than 30,000 training contents, or Education First: customizable language training offerings in virtual classroom, 1:1
and group settings.
Individual learning
Through easily accessible learning opportunities, we enable
our employees to learn according to their own needs and
schedules. With the help of digital technologies, we offer the
option of a personalized learning path. As part of our learning environment, customized content can specifically be selected from internal and external sources via the learning experience platform. We continuously update various learning
materials such as videos, books, courses, podcasts and articles in the areas of digitalization, artificial intelligence, inclusion and diversity and leadership.
The top three skills most frequently named by our employees are leadership, project management and change management.
Digitalization and artificial intelligence (AI) represent a major
opportunity for Bayer. Our focus lies on developing the skills
of our employees, especially in these fields. Additionally, we
provide learning offerings in IT and other business-critical areas such as production, sustainability and human resources.

Our leadership programs, mapped to Dynamic Shared Ownership (DSO) and Visionary, Architect, Catalyst and Coach (VACC)
behaviors, serve as the foundation for shaping a company culture in which every employee is empowered to contribute to our
common success, irrespective of his or her position.

6.5 Employee Development and
Integration

Functional academies such as the Innovation Academy,
IT Academy and R&D Academy offer advanced training in
various disciplines.
Based on the company’s Code of Conduct, full- and parttime employees and temporary employees from staffing
agencies complete the obligatory compliance and ongoing
vocational training, both through classroom-based courses
and computer-assisted education measures. Their completion is verified (the monitoring of training completion for
mandatory training units is performed by the responsible
content owner in the business).
Learning and training time averaged around 22.2 hours per
employee in 2024. The average cost of ongoing training per
employee was €667.
Every Bayer employee is eligible to receive training. Of the
total workforce, 88% completed at least one training offering.

Total

Bayer promotes a culture of candid feedback and encourages feedback in all directions – from leaders to employees,
between colleagues and from employees to leaders.
All our employees serve as role models and play an important part in promoting performance and further developing the feedback culture at Bayer. Employees continuously
seek opportunities to ask and provide feedback by reaching
out to people closest to their work. Likewise, leaders can
collect input from former leaders, work team colleagues and
other stakeholders.
Bayer’s virtual mentoring approach is available to all full-time
and part-time employees globally, allowing participants to
independently leverage professional development opportunities, either for their own benefit as a mentee or for others
as a mentor. The program is supported by an algorithm
based on artificial intelligence that brings together mentors
and mentees from throughout the Bayer Group. Since the
launch, more than 4,624 employees have registered; 48%
of participants are women and 52% are men.

Performance goals and development dialogues
Bayer pursues a globally standardized approach for performance evaluation and employee development. The performance evaluation procedure is available to 83% of our employees worldwide. Those excluded from this are primarily
employees whose existing works agreements do not allow
for individual performance assessments, for example in Germany.

6.5 Employee Development and Integration

Our employees and leaders can jointly set flexible annual
goals. In consultation with their leaders, employees can select goals of relevance for themselves and their work areas
and can also make flexible adjustments to the goals during
the entire year. In line with the Dynamic Shared Ownership
(DSO) operational model, we abolished the mandatory recording and tracking of goal setting and check-ins starting in
2024. We have made these changes to reduce the amount
of data entry and give employees and leaders more time to
focus on meaningful coaching conversations and connections.
Some 83% of our employees (70% of our nonmanagerials
and 99% of our leaders) can participate in a year-end evaluation. At the end of 2024, 98% of the eligible employees
(44% female and 56% male) received such an evaluation. In
addition, employees can regularly and openly discuss their
performance, challenges, ideas and well-being with their
leaders during check-ins.
Managers throughout the Group have the option of presenting Top Performance Awards to incentivize outstanding individual and team successes. These involve a variable payment to reward special achievements directly in a timely
fashion. Additional recognition programs are in place in
some countries. In many countries, employees are recognized with years-of-service awards.
Employees can evaluate perspectives for their further career
development together with their leaders. Such discussions,
known as development dialogues, can identify a training
need that can be thematically covered by the MyLearning
management system and the GoLearn learning experience
platform (please see chapter 6.4 Learning and Training).
Thanks to our wide-ranging business activities, employees
throughout the Bayer Group can access various opportunities for development. Vacancies throughout the Bayer Group,

from nonmanagerial right up to upper management level, are
advertised via a globally accessible platform.

whom the person asking the question does not normally
have any contact.

Supporting scientists
To maintain an enthusiasm for Bayer among top researchers
and scientists, we offer them special development opportunities that are tailored to their requirements. These include
new scientific challenges, special advanced training offerings
and a career path either as experts or as managers in various Bayer regions, functions or divisions. Through our Science Fellows Community, we talk to our scientific specialists
about their own career development. Special mentoring programs are established to support employees’ early development and their regular networking with experienced scientists and managers.

Rewarding ideas
To promote a culture of innovation in the workplace, additional platforms for making work-related suggestions are
available to employees in Germany, such as the Bayer Ideas
Pool and the Ideas Forum. The suggestions made here by
employees on improving processes, occupational safety and
health protection are rewarded and utilized. Some 3,059
ideas were submitted in 2024, and 39% of the suggestions
for improvement evaluated in 2024 were implemented. In the
first year of implementation alone, those improvements that
led to quantifiable benefits generated savings of some
€4.5 million. In 2024, Bayer distributed bonuses of around
€1.4 million for the implemented proposals.

Promoting dialogue and exchange
Bayer offers employees numerous means of actively discussing company-specific topics and scope for optimization
via various internal communication channels. We actively
involve our employees in business processes by offering
the opportunity for dialogue. Informing staff comprehensively
and in good time about upcoming internal company changes,
in compliance with the applicable national and international
regulations, is very important to us.
We engage in open and trustful dialogue with employee
representatives worldwide. The main dialogue formats are
regular employee assemblies and information events for
managers, as well as the European Forum, at which employee representatives from European sites engage in discussion with the Board of Management and other company
managers on topics of overarching relevance to the company.
Our employees can submit Bayer-related questions through
the internal crowdsourcing platform WeSolve to obtain innovative ideas on an interdisciplinary basis. These questions
are then answered with the help of other employees with

Volunteer work to support social projects and
initiatives
Inspired by our purpose of “Science for a better life,”
our mission of “Health for all, Hunger for none” and our
commitment to conserve and protect the environment,
Bayer employees have long volunteered their own time
on behalf of their communities. For example, our employees founded the Pro Social Initiatives (PROSI) in
2018, which networks employees worldwide for social
volunteering initiatives. A Global Corporate Volunteering Procedure was introduced in 2023 with Germany
as a first mover country, enabling employees to take
one day off per year with pay for volunteering services
with social organizations. Employees can use an online
platform for volunteering services to search for organizations and events to actively support. The platform
also enables participants to create volunteering offerings and share them with other Bayer employees. In
total, 27 countries to date have introduced a

volunteering program based on the global guidelines
and utilizing the global platform (approx. 51,000 employees have access to the portal). In parallel, already
existing local volunteering programs (such as those in
the United States) continue to be maintained and successfully managed locally. In total, over 450 volunteering projects were conducted in 2024 leading to over
27,800 of hours of company-sponsored volunteering
leave for our employees.

Further information regarding freedom of association can be
found in the Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report
2024.

6.7 Work-Life Integration
We help our employees to balance their work and private
lives. Taking their individual situation into account, we give
them flexibility in shaping their working hours and work locations and offer them parental leave and support with childcare and caring for close relatives. In many countries, our
commitment in this area goes beyond the statutory requirements. An overview of the selected benefits for employees in
each country can be found at the end of this chapter.

Another example of employee engagement is the charitable donation program Helping Cents. Through this,
our employees in Germany can donate the “spare
cents” after the decimal point on their monthly payslip
for charitable projects. Bayer then doubles these donations. In 2024, 7,649 employees took part in this
and donated around €41,000.

6.6 Employee Rights

Hybrid working

Employees at all Bayer sites around the world have the right
to elect their own representatives. In 2024, the working conditions for around 53% of our employees worldwide were
governed by collective or company agreements. At various
country companies, the interests of the workforce are represented by elected employee representatives who have a right
to be consulted on certain personnel-related decisions.

Within the scope of our Next Normal Office and New
Ways of Working concepts, we fundamentally give our
employees the possibility to align with their supervisor
whether and in which manner hybrid working is possible with a flexible mix of mobile work and presence at
the workplace.

The increased use of flexible working models is part of
our Next Normal Office Concept, in which our employees at all hierarchy levels (empowerment) are given
more flexibility and responsibility. In line with the requirements of (labor) law and taking into account cultural differences, we want to meet the needs of our
employees and customers and thus strengthen our
business operations.

Bayer in Germany has agreed to uniform conditions for
mobile working in a General Works Agreement with the
Works Council. Through this, employees have the freedom to work remotely on certain days which is subject
to alignment with and consent of their supervisor.

Health provision
“Health for all” is a core element of our corporate mission,
which is why the health of our employees is of the utmost
importance for us. We have established health provision
programs and support access to reliable and high-quality
healthcare. For information on our occupational health and
safety measures, please see chapter 8. Health and Safety.
Our occupational health management activities include
numerous additional preventive programs, ranging from
ergonomic workplace and stress management initiatives to
incentive systems to promote healthy behavior. Employees
can access these programs through Bayer’s intranet and
through internal and external company benefits platforms. Our
employee representatives are included in occupational health
management and are actively involved in its further development. The Bayer European Forum – which brings together
management and employee representatives – has signed the
Luxembourg Declaration on Workplace Health Promotion in
the EU and is committed to the principles contained therein
regarding the implementation of workplace health promotion.
Health check-ups are an integral part of our global health promotion initiatives.
We want to provide employees in all countries with access
to reliable and high-quality healthcare. Almost 99% of
our employees worldwide have either statutory or private
health insurance or can obtain health insurance through
the company.

This includes employer- and employee-driven terminations, severance agreements and
departures following the expiration of employment contracts.

In addition, using the BayZeit long-term account, employees
in Germany can convert part of their salary into free time,
which they can later take off to care for children or dependents, or to take part in an advanced training course, for example. We also enable and support job sharing at Bayer (including in leadership positions).
The General Works Agreement on caring for close relatives
helps Bayer employees in Germany to combine their work
with their role as carers by utilizing adapted worktime models
and taking temporary paid leaves.

Bayer enables both men and women to take parental leave,
although national parental leave regulations vary widely from
country to country. Some 1,195 women and 1,477 men took
parental leave in 2024. Over the course of the year, 2,113
employees returned to work from parental leave.
The next table uses Germany as an example and shows the
number of employees who have returned to work after opting
for the standard statutory parental leave program of up to
three years per child. By the end of 2024, 76% had returned to
work. Some 64% of women and 89% of men who have taken
parental leave since 2022 have returned to work.

7.1 Management Approach

7. Environment
Protecting the environment is one of our highest priorities.
We work continuously to reduce the environmental impact of
our business activities and develop product solutions that
benefit the environment. In our Sustainability Statement in
the Annual Report 2024 we report on the material Environmental sustainability matters of E2 Pollution, E3 Water and
Marine Resources, E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems and E5
Resources use and circular economy.

7.1 Management Approach
Responsibility for steering and monitoring environmental protection aspects, as well as health and safety, across the
Group lies with the Public Affairs, Sustainability & Safety
(PASS) Enabling Function. This function is assigned to the
Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO), who also
serves as Bayer’s Chief Sustainability Officer. The PASS Enabling Function establishes responsibilities, targets, key performance indicators and framework conditions for the entire
Group. These conditions include the provisions of the Group
Regulation on HSE Management and HSE Key Requirements,
which forms an integral part of the global health, safety and
environmental protection (HSE) management system and describes the approach for coordinating and monitoring environmental processes at Bayer and defines core environmental requirements that need to be implemented worldwide.
Management systems for environmental protection are in
place, and these are integrated into the business processes
throughout the Group. Operational responsibility for environmental protection lies with the individual sites and divisions,
which steer HSE via management systems, committees and
working groups at our sites. Incident and emergency preparedness is managed at site level, with a global notification
procedure in place.

Environmental management at the sites also involves the development and implementation of site-specific environmental
protection targets and programs to reduce our environmental impact. Environmental protection measures are identified,
planned and implemented through cross-functional cooperation between the divisions and enabling functions. The following priorities apply:
// Avoiding waste/emissions
// Recycling in all cases where it is practicable to do so
by reasonable means
// Minimizing waste/emissions that cannot be avoided
or recycled
We report all relevant environmental data of the Group, including for all fully consolidated companies in which we have
a share of more than 50%, collect data on environmental incidents at all sites worldwide, and record environmental indicators at 219 environmentally relevant production, research
and administration sites, compiling this in the Group-wide
system. All sites where annual energy consumption exceeds
1.5 terajoules or annual water withdrawal is greater than or
equal to 50 Tm³ to be environmentally relevant.
Ecological & Sustainability Assessments for capital expenditures
Our environmental commitment extends beyond the scope
of legal requirements. We perform voluntary Ecological &
Sustainability Assessments for capital expenditure projects
exceeding €10 million. This includes an evaluation of direct
and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. The goal is to adequately assess environmental impact and other sustainability
dimensions and involve stakeholders at an early stage.

The Ecological & Sustainability Assessments ensure uniform
environmental and sustainability standards worldwide, taking
into account Bayer’s internal standards and the best available technologies (BAT), according to EU standards. The assessments ensure that we safeguard our capital expenditures over the long term by anticipating and addressing
future legislative changes at an early stage. Examples of the
implementation of capital expenditure projects can be found
in this chapter and in the Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024.
In the case of acquisitions, we examine compliance with the
applicable environmental regulations as well as fundamental
employee rights at the production sites in question. Through
our HSE management systems, we also avoid damage and
disruptions to work and production.
Environmental management systems
In accordance with the Group Regulation on HSE Management and HSE Key Requirements, our sites must have environmental management systems in place that follow recognized international standards such as ISO 14001. We aim to
cover 80% of our business activities (based on energy consumption at environmentally relevant sites) with certification
to ISO 14001 or ISO 45001 by the end of 2025.

7.1 Management Approach

At the European level, we are required to comply with the
EU Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EU), which stipulates that companies must conduct regular energy audits or
implement an ISO 50001-certified energy management system. The sites subject to these requirements are responsible for taking the necessary actions and are also subject to
audits conducted by internal and external experts. In total,
18 sites have been certified in accordance with ISO 50001
in 2024.
Internal HSE audits
Audits are an integral component of our global HSE management system and include environmental aspects, such
as emissions into the air, wastewater or waste handling.
They assist in ensuring compliance with applicable environmentally relevant regulations and improve our environmental
performance worldwide. HSE audits help to safeguard our license to operate through the identification and mitigation of
possible environmental risks. Bayer’s global HSE audit program is based on the international standard ISO 19011 and
comprises both general HSE audits and process and plant
safety audits. The Group Regulation on Health, Safety and
Environmental (HSE) Audits defines the basic principles and
methodology for selecting, planning, implementing and
post-processing audits according to a risk-based approach.
Through the overarching HSE audit approach, we include all
environmentally relevant sites and apply uniform standards
worldwide. When selecting sites for audit, the focus is particularly on production sites, major Bayer warehouses, sites
with research and development units and major seed treatment and processing units.
The frequency of audits is determined by considering the
risk category (based partly on the size of the site or the type
of production activity), the performance evaluation (based
partly on past audit results, for example) and risk-mitigating
measures (e.g. existing environmentally relevant certifications such as to ISO 14001), and ranges from every two to

every seven years. Incident-based audits can be carried out
in addition to this. The audit criteria comprise all applicable
environmental protection regulations and standards for the
area being audited, including Bayer regulations, local HSE
management system regulations, locally applicable legal requirements, permit requirements and international standards
(e.g. ISO 14001). If deficiencies in compliance with legal regulations are identified, additional compliance audits can be
planned. Within the scope of these audits, action plans and
responsibilities are established to fix the issues identified.
The respective site management, the divisional management and the PASS Enabling Function are notified of the
audit findings. Supplementary to the global HSE audits,
sites and country organizations carry out their own internal
HSE audits or self-inspections according to a site-specific,
risk-based approach.
As per our global annual HSE audit program, a total of 44
global internal HSE and process and plant safety audits
were conducted in 2024 (2023: 64).
HSE audits of suppliers
Within the scope of our responsibility, our audit activities
also extend to our supply chain. HSE and sustainability audits combine to form an efficient evaluation approach, taking
account of the various risks (see chapter 4. Procurement).
Internal and external auditors evaluate selected new and existing suppliers. These audits include environmental aspects.
Audits are performed, for example, on toll or contract manufacturers, active ingredient suppliers and warehouses with
significant HSE risk potential, considering the type of materials, manufacturing processes and environmental impact.
Local, regional and global audits are designed to establish
short and effective paths to the respective suppliers based on
the respective risk. The results of these HSE audits are taken
into consideration in the supplier selection and management
processes. In 2024, 339 (2023: 363) supplier audits were

conducted, either as HSE audits or audits covering HSE
topics (such as sustainability audits).
In case nonconformities are identified during an audit, corrective actions are agreed with the supplier and progress on
completion is monitored, with a focus on major and critical
findings.
Biodiversity
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems.
Biodiversity is an interdisciplinary topic that is relevant for
Bayer and our value chain in various respects. Activities at
Bayer therefore focus on the responsible use of natural resources to conserve and protect ecosystems, species and
genetic biodiversity. The drug discovery process and discovery of crop protection active ingredients can benefit from biodiversity, while biodiversity is vital for the development of
new seed varieties. We have spelled out this stance in our
Position on Conservation and Restoration of Biodiversity in
Agriculture and Forestry.
Bayer supports the objectives of the United Nations’ Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), including the fair and
equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of
genetic resources, as well as the goals of the International
Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture
of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United
Nations, which prescribes the balanced and fair division of
use of plant genetic resources. Our Group Regulation on Access & Use of Genetic Resources defines the principles of
how to manage access to and the use and transfer of genetic resources and/or traditional knowledge throughout the
company.
Since 1993, Bayer has partnered with the Wildlife Habitat
Council (WHC) to promote sustainability, wildlife preservation,
biodiversity and environmental education at the company’s

7.2 Climate

WHC-certified sites. There are currently 58 Bayer programs
in total registered with the Wildlife Habitat Council. Some 29
of our sites are certified, three of which achieved Gold Certification and five Silver Certification. Sites seeking certification
from WHC must demonstrate a high standard of achievement through observations, documentation and employee
participation in protecting habitats. Programs at the certified
sites include habitats such as grassland and forest, along
with species such as pollinators and birds, and also focus on
promoting awareness and community engagement. Through
initiatives on our corporate grounds, we have established
habitats at around 70 Bayer research and manufacturing
sites across North America, Latin America and Europe.

7.2 Climate
Climate change affects us all and is one of the most important challenges that humankind will face in the future.
Bayer considers climate protection and the related reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions to be a top priority. We support the Paris Agreement and the objective of limiting global
warming to 1.5 °C relative to the preindustrial level. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has validated our target
and confirms our contribution to fulfilling the Paris Agreement. We anticipate that our business areas of healthcare
and agriculture will on the one hand be impacted by climate
change, but on the other will also be part of the solution.
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on the material Environmental sustainability matters of E1 Climate change. In addition, we provide a short
summary here.
The Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) holds
direct responsibility for climate protection in his role as Chief
Sustainability Officer. In keeping with their level of
importance, climate-change-related topics and Bayer’s
climate strategy were discussed at a total of four meetings
with the Board of Management, one meeting of the

Supervisory Board and both meetings of the ESG Committee of the Supervisory Board in 2024. The attainment of our
Group targets to reduce greenhouse gases by 2029 is factored into the long-term compensation of the Board of Management and Bayer’s long-term variable compensation (LTI)entitled managerial employees. The compensation-relevant
target is based on Bayer’s necessary contribution to a Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-validated 1.5 °C scenario. Climate protection is also an integral element of annual variable compensation.
The Sustainability Council advises the Board of Management
in all matters relating to sustainability – including climate
protection. In 2024, climate change and the related impacts
on and opportunities for Bayer were discussed at three meetings of the Sustainability Council. The CEO is supported in
this by the Public Affairs, Sustainability & Safety (PASS) Enabling Function and the sustainability departments within the
divisions. The divisions handle the operational implementation
of the climate protection measures at their sites with the support of the Enabling Functions. We have formed Group-wide
working groups for the strategic and operational implementation of climate-change-related measures and a special working group to analyze various climate scenarios and their impacts on our business.
As part of the Bayer Transition and Transformation Plan, we
take active steps to address the challenges arising from climate change. We pursue an approach that is based on transition and transformation.
The transition part centers around reducing our own emissions in line with the Paris climate goals.

Targets for 2024
In 2020, we had set targets for 2024. We aimed
// to achieve a 20% reduction of our combined Scope 1 and
2 greenhouse gas emissions (comprises direct emissions
[Scope 1] and indirect [Scope 2, market-based] greenhouse gas emissions from Bayer sites with an annual energy consumption exceeding 1.5 terajoules) compared to
the base year 2019; and
// to reduce our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 6%
(based on the five categories of Scope 3 greenhouse gas
emissions according to the GHG Protocol that are relevant for us: (3.1) purchased goods and services, (3.2)
capital goods, (3.3) fuel- and energy-related activities,
(3.4) upstream transportation and distribution and (3.6)
business travel) compared to the base year 2019.
Compared with the base year 2019, we reduced our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by
21.3% and our target-related Scope 3 greenhouse gas
emissions by 12.7% in 2024.
Targets for 2029
In 2020, we set ourselves a target of achieving a 42% reduction in absolute combined Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse
gas emissions (comprises direct emissions [Scope 1] and indirect [Scope 2, market-based] greenhouse gas emissions
from Bayer sites with an annual energy consumption exceeding 1.5 terajoules) compared with the base year 2019
by the year 2029.
In 2020, we also set ourselves a target of achieving a 12.3%
reduction in absolute Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions
compared with the base year 2019 by the year 2029. The
reduction is based on the five categories of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions according to the GHG Protocol that
are relevant for us: (3.1) purchased goods and services,
(3.2) capital goods, (3.3) fuel- and energy-related activities,

In the future we want to achieve a 25% reduction in Scope 3
greenhouse gas emissions by 2029 (compared to the base
year 2019). This updated target for reducing Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions was validated by the SBTi at the end of
2024. This reduction will be based on a different number of relevant Scope 3 categories including the upstream and downstream value chain, thus going beyond the five categories we
were using in the last years. We will publish more details on
this over the course of 2025.
Net zero target 2050
Our goal is to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions
including the entire value chain by 2050. This corresponds
to a 90% reduction in absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions compared with the base year 2019 (total Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions; comprises direct [Scope 1] and indirect [Scope 2,
market-based] greenhouse gas emissions from Bayer sites
with an annual energy consumption exceeding 1.5 terajoules; Scope 3 includes all Scope 3 categories defined in
the GHG Protocol). We intend to offset the remaining greenhouse gas emissions (10%) through long-term carbon credits (the neutralization of the remaining emissions will be carried out in accordance with the standards of the Science
Based Targets initiative [SBTi]). We will offset the residual
emissions through certificates with long-term carbon capture. This target was validated in 2024 by the SBTi organization and is in line with the UN Sustainable Development
Goals, the Paris Agreement to limit warming to 1.5 °C, and
the Business Ambition for 1.5 °C of the UN Global Compact
Initiative.

7.4 Water

We use specialized off-gas treatment equipment at our
production sites to reduce or eliminate pollutants in off-gas.
Such equipment is generally tailored to the specific off-gas
streams. This usually includes:

Redundant off-gas treatment facilities are available at sites
with critical off-gas components. One example is an activated carbon facility at a site in Germany that serves as a
redundancy measure for thermal off-gas treatment.

// Thermal off-gas treatment systems to eliminate volatile
organic compounds (VOCs)
// Gas scrubbers to reduce VOCs and acid gases
// Particulate collectors such as cyclones to reduce
particulate emissions

Bayer continued to implement or completed a number of
capital expenditure projects in 2024 focusing on the construction of new exhaust air treatment facilities or the modernization of existing facilities. This includes, for example,
three new off-gas treatment facilities featuring thermal oxidation at production sites in Germany.

The facilities are equipped with sensors for process control
and continuous monitoring of the functions. In accordance
with regulatory requirements, off-gas samples are also analyzed by certified laboratories to verify compliance with legal thresholds (see graphic).

7.4 Water
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on the material Environmental sustainability matters of E3 Water and marine resources.
Responsible water usage is a cornerstone of our commitment
to sustainable development and is described in the Group
Regulation on HSE Management and HSE Key Requirements.
Clean water in sufficient quantities is essential for the health of
people, animals and plants. That is why it is crucial that industrial water usage does not lead to local problems, such as

water shortages for the people living in the catchment areas of
our production sites in the future. To maximize impact, our activities go beyond our own sites and comprise measures
throughout the value chain – from our suppliers through internal operational procedures to the farmers we supply.
Water strategy
Our comprehensive water strategy covers potential water-related risks along our value chain. We want to deploy Bayer’s
innovation capability to generate value added for society
while also creating new business opportunities.
Cornerstones of our water strategy are:
// Resilient agriculture: Bayer aims to help increase water
productivity in farming. Our top priority is rice-growing, for
which irrigation accounts for up to 43% of global water extraction. We have set a target to support our smallholder
customers to increase water productivity by 25% by 2030
against a 2019–2021 average baseline by transforming
rice cropping in the relevant geographies where Bayer operates, starting in India. Water productivity is defined as
kilogram of crop yield per volume of water applied (kg/m3).
The baseline validation is still ongoing. Our water target is
currently focusing on the DirectAcres Initiative, which aims
at supporting farmers shift successfully from transplanted
puddled rice to mechanized direct seeded rice.
// As we consider water a scarce and essential resource
for life, we incorporate water quality and quantity into
business and investment decisions to mitigate climate
risks. As part of Bayer’s Ecological & Sustainability Assessments for new investments, all investments above €
10 million must be evaluated regarding their environmental impact. This assessment includes both a product
and a process evaluation. The process evaluation assesses the site-specific impacts of the new investment
projects on the local environment and organisms. The
outcome is an improved risk assessment at site level to
secure safe handling and use of substances as well as

the prevention of incidents and emissions into air, water
and soil.
When evaluating water-related risks, we consider factors
such as the proximity to water-scarce regions, floodprone areas, and our own consumption and discharge
practices. These factors are integral to our decision-making process.
We value water at our own sites through water checks
with detailed flow analyses, monitoring of drought and
flood risks, water management systems for sites in water
scarce areas and assessment of Predicted No Effect
Concentrations (PNECs).
Suppliers: Bayer included specific aspects relating to water and wastewater in the Supplier Code of Conduct updated in 2022, and in our evaluation of the suppliers’ sustainability risk and in supplier audits.
Our sites and facilities: Bayer is committed to providing
clean drinking water and sanitary facilities for all employees at our sites (WASH). We also want to continue reducing emissions into wastewater at our sites worldwide.
Furthermore, we have voluntarily established very strict
limits for the discharge of active ingredients into
wastewater for the sites where they are produced. To reduce our impact and dependency on water resources at
relevant sites in water-scarce regions, we want to build
on our existing water management systems and expand
them to sites located in regions that will be subjected to
water stress by 2030. This includes a risk evaluation that
covers accessibility, availability and quality. We want to
establish context-related water targets for our own operations by 2025 that we plan to achieve by 2030.
Bayer as an ambassador and partner: It will take broad
action by many supporters to deal with the water crisis.
Bayer has a strong network through its participation in
various initiatives. These include the World Meteorological
Organization for Water and Climate Leaders and the Water Resilience Coalition (WRC), International Drought Resilience Alliance (IDRA), an initiative forged during COP29
at the ministers’ meeting of the United Nations

continues to support the CEO Water Mandate of the UN
Global Compact with the goal of working with key stakeholders to develop sustainable strategies for water usage.
We are also a member of the WRC, which concretizes
and complements the ambitions of the CEO Water Mandate at a private-sector level.
In our Water Position, we commit to complying with international, national and local legislation, and thus to protecting
water resources, using them as sparingly as possible and to
further reducing emissions into water.
In our annual response to the CDP Questionnaire, we report
in detail on our handling of water. This equates to a progress

report for the CEO Water Mandate. We received an A rating
from CDP in 2024.

Water target:
We aim to support our smallholder customers to increase water productivity* by 25% by 2030 against a

Water withdrawal and recycling
Water is used at our sites for many different purposes, including cooling, heating, cleaning, sanitation, irrigation and
product manufacturing. Our water recycling and reuse of
385 million m³ (2023: 381 million m³) is supplemented by
freshwater withdrawals of 53 million m³, which results in a
theoretical recycling rate of 720% (2023: 715%).
Recycling measures include closure of cooling cycles, reuse
of treated wastewater and recirculation of steam condensates as process water or to irrigate fields. Our production
sites for crop protection products (Crop Science Division)
account for the greatest share of water recycling. Water is
currently recycled by various means at 53 sites, which are
responsible for 46% of the water withdrawn by Bayer. Water
recycling is almost impossible in seed production, where
water is mainly used to irrigate farmland. In pharmaceutical
production, the water recycling rate is low due to stringent
legal requirements (Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health
divisions).

We aim to identify potentials for improvement, particularly in
areas at water risk, including areas of high-water stress. The
information on the topic “total water consumption in m3 in
areas at water risk, including areas of high-water stress” is
described in the Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024.

To avert current and future risks for our sites and the local
communities, particularly in the context of climate change,
we are placing special emphasis on sites that will be threatened by high water stress by 2030 (WRI, basic scenario)
and that have water withdrawals above 50 Tm³.
In 2023, we met our goal of establishing suitable water management systems at all those sites. In 2024, we have revised
the evaluation system and updated the sites in scope,
based on new WRI data. The key characteristics of a sustainable water management are a balance between water
consumption and availability, and the optimal conservation of
water resources.
Water discharge (including wastewater emissions)
Water discharge refers to the water released to surface water,
groundwater or third parties. The total volume of water discharged was 32 million m³ in 2024. This includes around
nine million m³ (27%) of noncontact cooling water that is
only heated in the course of the cooling process and does
not come into contact with products. It is returned to the
water cycle without further treatment, in line with the relevant official permits. In 2024, we discharged 0.8 million m³
of sanitary wastewater and 23.1 million m³ of industrial and
mixed wastewater. Following careful analysis according to
official provisions, 4.6 million m³ (20% of the industrial and
mixed wastewater) were categorized as being not environmentally hazardous and returned to the natural water cycle.
The remaining 18.5 million m³ wastewater (80% of the industrial and mixed wastewater) was purified in wastewater treatment plants (Bayer-owned or third-party facilities), usually
through biological wastewater treatment in combination
with upstream and/or downstream treatment steps. Suitable
treatment processes such as adsorption, precipitation or
Fenton oxidation are used, depending on the wastewater
composition, flow rate and required separation efficiency.

Our wastewater treatment facilities are equipped with sensors for continuous monitoring and process control. In accordance with regulatory requirements, samples are also analyzed by certified laboratories to verify compliance with
legal thresholds; see the graphic on the right.
We aim to minimize emissions at our sites worldwide, including emissions into wastewater. Environmental management at our sites therefore includes the monitoring and reduction of emissions into wastewater. Our approach to this
issue is described in the Group Regulation on HSE Management and HSE Key Requirements. For active (pharmaceutical) ingredients we specify internal thresholds that are based
on risk assessments and often go beyond legal requirements. The approach is described in our Group Regulation
on Management of Active Ingredients in Wastewater, which
applies to all production sites at which active ingredients are
produced or processed.

Bayer continued to implement or completed a number of
capital expenditure projects in 2024 focusing on reducing
our water withdrawals and modernizing our wastewater
treatment facilities. Key initiatives included:
// Process improvements at a facility in Germany that resulted in a reduction of water withdrawals by 500 m³ per
year while simultaneously increasing production by 37%
// A series of smaller projects aimed at reducing water withdrawals at a site in the United States by 15% by 2028
// The development of a new precipitation unit in Germany
designed to remove heavy metals from wastewater, with
a planned investment of €4 million
// The establishment of a new unit for phosphorus removal
at a production site in Brazil
// The conceptualization of a new wastewater treatment
plant in Mexico

Remediation and safeguarding of soil and
groundwater contamination
In line with the Group Regulation on HSE Management
and HSE Key Requirements, Bayer ensures the implementation of measures to prevent the contamination of
soil and groundwater. These include inspecting facilities for leaks, installation of effective secondary

retention measures for storage tanks, and maintenance and inspection programs. The measures also
encompass applying suitable leak identification devices for tanks, containers and pipes containing hazardous materials as well as the installation of sealed
surfaces with a sufficient retention volume, for example in tank loading and unloading areas.
Bayer also actively performs remediation activities to
mitigate historical environmental damage, e.g. resulting from unnoticed releases, noncompliant waste
management or application of past environmental
standards that were less stringent. Dedicated processes have been established for this purpose that
stipulate comprehensive investigation of sites and,
where necessary, one or more of the following
measures:
// Remediation activities to clean up the impacted
environment
// Safeguarding contaminated sites so that they
no longer constitute a danger
// Monitoring the remediation and safeguarding
activities conducted
These are implemented based on statutory requirements and the latest technological standards. Such
activities are also designed to avert possible financial
damage or reputational risks to the company.
To manage contamination, we have established uniform standards worldwide in our Group regulation for
the investigation and remediation of such sites. Our
specialized teams work systematically with external
experts to support all affected sites in the planning,
implementation and monitoring of remediation processes and measures, assess their progress, and

execute and conclude these cases with a positive
effect for people and nature.
// To enable the implementation of environmental protection measures and the mitigation of contamination, provisions are established for the expected
costs of the remediation of contaminated sites, the
recultivation of landfills, the clean-up of environmental pollution at existing production or storage sites
and similar measures. For more information on provisions, please see the 2024 Annual Report.

7.5 Waste and Recycling
We aim to minimize material consumption and disposal volumes as much as possible through systematic waste management. Waste separation, safe disposal channels and reasonable recycling processes contribute to this. In accordance
with our Group regulations, all production sites are obliged to
prevent, reduce and recycle waste and to dispose of it safely
and in line with good environmental practices.
Each of our sites must have an up-to-date waste register
that includes the following details for each waste stream: the
name and description of the waste, its source and volume
and sufficient information on its composition, hazard classification and final treatment and disposal. Bayer ensures that
waste is properly disposed of, including audits of external
disposal facilities.
Volume of waste generated
Waste volumes and recycling paths are impacted not just by
production fluctuations but also by building refurbishment
and land remediation work. The total volume of waste generated decreased by around 12% in 2024 compared to 2023.
This was mainly attributed to a decrease in corn production
and therefore biomass waste in several South America sites.

The total volume of hazardous waste decreased by 9% to
288,000 metric tons (2023: 316,000 metric tons) owing to
decreased production at various active ingredient manufacturing sites.

Volume of waste disposed of
Waste can be stored at sites as an intermediate step. For
this reason, the volume of waste disposed of can differ
slightly from the volume of waste generated by Bayer.
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on waste directed to disposal according to ESRS
in E5 Circular Economy.
Disposal, recycling and processing
Some 55% (2023: 54%) of total waste was successfully reused or recycled. The proportion of hazardous waste recycled was around 12%.
Bayer’s finished products, such as pharmaceuticals, crop
protection products and seeds, are used almost exclusively
as consumable materials for which reuse through recycling
or recovery processes, as outlined in approaches to a circular economy, is not possible. The recovery of products from
pharmaceutical and chemical production waste occurs only
in individual cases due to significant regulatory and technical
hurdles.

7.5 Waste and Recycling

The disposal of pharmaceutical products is subject to strict
safety criteria. Packaging materials for crop protection products are recycled in line with national regulations and according to country-specific infrastructures for waste disposal. In many countries with no legal regulation, the
industry has set up a returns system in collaboration with
other providers (for more information, please see chapter 3.
Product Stewardship).

//

//

Whenever possible within the framework of legal regulations,
we make use of the opportunities in our divisions to recycle
solvents, catalysts and intermediates and return them to the
production process after treatment. Recycling plays an especially important role in our production of crop protection
products and is therefore a key criterion at the process development stage of active ingredient production.

//

In all divisions, production- and material-based recycling
is aligned to the individual requirements of the production
processes at the sites. Here are some examples:

//

// Material-based recycling of solvents from production is
implemented at various active ingredient production sites.
// Volumes of incineration waste are being reduced at a site
in the United States using distillation. At the same time,
occupational safety has improved because less manual
intervention is required in the process.
// At a site in Germany, a patented recycling process is
employed to recover iodine and return it to the industrial
supply chain. The iodine is recovered from leftover contrast agent collected at medical facilities through the
re:contrast returns program or from our own production
waste. Unused products are currently recovered through
re:contrast from hospitals in eight countries, and it is
planned to introduce this program in the UK in the future.
We recycle contrast agent waste from an additional production site in Spain. In addition to iodine recycling, the
re:contrast returns program also collects leftovers of gadolinium-based contrast agents and recycles them through

//

//

an external partner (please see also chapter 3. Product
Stewardship).
Mirroring the re:contrast program, old injectors are taken
back, refurbished or repaired and reused as spare parts
through the re:device program.
Plant residues (such as corncobs or rice husks) from seed
production are reused as animal feed, as raw material for
various corn products, as natural fertilizers or as fuels at
our seed production sites.
Employees and contractors at three sites in Argentina are
being given extensive training that enables them to avoid
disposal of waste products in landfills. The waste streams
are either reused, recycled, composted or incinerated.
At a production site in Spain, the plan is to use gelatin
waste for biogas production, which will enable a reduction in the volume of incinerated waste and associated
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
Through the application of optimization techniques in the
production process at a plant in Germany, significant
achievements have been made beyond waste reduction,
including substantial energy and water savings.
In our recent office project in Belgium, we have upheld
our commitment to sustainable practices by significantly
reducing our environmental footprint due to the rightsizing
of the office. This has been achieved through careful,
sustainable reuse of furniture and equipment and by using energy-efficient systems, reinforcing our dedication to
environmentally conscious decision-making across all
new office projects.

Recycling of business equipment
The purchase of new business equipment is associated not just with monetary costs, but also with the
products’ ecological footprint. The internal reutilization
or sale of unused and/or unneeded business equipment is therefore cost-effective and supports more resource-friendly business practices.
Together with a service provider, Bayer has therefore
established a transparent global platform to internally
list unused production and laboratory equipment
through which employees at various sites can view
available items. The platform also supports the administration and possible sale of these items. The goal is
to reuse equipment or individual parts that are no
longer needed at one site elsewhere internally – or, if
there is no need for it, to sell it externally, donate it or
recycle it as a final step.

8.1 Management Approach

8. Health and Safety
Ensuring the safety of people working at and for Bayer and
of those who live near our sites is our highest priority. We
extend these ambitions to our supply chain, too. Bayer focuses on taking consistent precautions – to ensure healthy
working conditions and safety in day-to-day work, in the operation of production facilities, and on work-related travel
and transportation routes.
Safeguarding the occupational health and safety of our employees, and that of the employees of contractors (commissioned outside companies) who are under the direct supervision of Bayer, involves preventing occupational accidents
and occupational illnesses, assessing potential hazards, ensuring comprehensive risk management and creating a
healthy working environment.
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024
we report on health and safety as part of S1 Own Workforce.

8.1 Management Approach
Responsibility for steering and monitoring health and safety
aspects across the Group lies with the Public Affairs, Sustainability & Safety (PASS) Enabling Function, which is assigned to the Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO),
who also serves as Bayer's Chief Sustainability Officer. This
Enabling Function establishes responsibilities, targets, key
performance indicators and framework conditions for the
entire Group. These conditions include the provisions of the
Group Regulation on HSE Management and HSE Key Requirements, which forms an integral part of the global
health, safety and environmental protection (HSE) management system, which was approved by Public Affairs, Sustainability & Safety. The Group Regulation on HSE

Management and HSE Key Requirements describes the approach for coordinating and monitoring health and safety
processes at Bayer and defines core health and safety requirements that need to be implemented worldwide.
More detailed requirements for individual health and safety
aspects are established in addition to our Group Regulation
on HSE Management and HSE Key Requirements. These
are also binding.
Operational responsibility for health and safety lies with the
individual sites and divisions, which steer HSE via management systems, committees and working groups at our sites.
Incident and emergency preparedness is managed at site
level, with a global notification procedure in place.
We collect and report data on occupational injuries/illnesses
at all sites worldwide.
Management systems for health and safety
In accordance with the Group Regulation on HSE Management and HSE Key Requirements, our sites must have management systems for health and safety in place following
recognized international standards (e.g. ISO 45001).

Internal HSE audits
Audits covering health and safety topics are an integral
component of our global HSE management system. They
help to ensure compliance with applicable health and safety
regulations, and to improve our health and safety performance worldwide. By identifying and mitigating potential
health and safety risks, HSE audits contribute to safeguarding our license to operate. Bayer’s global HSE audit program
is based on the international standard ISO 19011 and comprises both general HSE audits and process and plant safety
audits. The Group Regulation on Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Audits defines the basic principles and methodology for selection, planning, execution and follow-up activities for these audits following a risk-based approach. The
overarching HSE audit approach includes all units and ensures application of uniform standards worldwide. When selecting sites for audit, the focus is particularly on production
sites, major Bayer warehouses, sites with research and development units, and major seed treatment and processing
units.
The audit frequency is determined by the risk category
(based on the size of the site and the type of production
activity), the performance evaluation (based on the results of
previous audits) and risk-mitigating measures (e.g. existing
ISO certifications), and ranges from two to seven years.
Event-driven audits can be carried out in addition to this.
The audit criteria comprise all applicable health and safety
regulations and standards for the area being audited, including Bayer regulations, local HSE management system regulations, locally applicable legal requirements, permit

requirements and international standards (e.g. ISO 45001). If
deficiencies with respect to compliance with legal regulations are identified, additional compliance audits can be
planned. Within the scope of these audits, action plans and
responsibilities are established to correct the issues identified. As per our global annual HSE Audit program, a total of
44 global internal HSE and Process & Plant Safety (PPS) audits were conducted in 2024 (2023: 64).
The respective site management, divisional management
and the respective management of the PASS Enabling Function as well as HSE are notified of the audit results.
In addition to the global HSE audits, sites and country organizations carry out their own internal HSE audits or selfinspections according to their own specific risk-based approach.

audit, corrective actions are agreed with the supplier and
progress on completion is monitored, with a focus on major
and critical findings. The Supplier Code of Conduct describes further details.
Engagement
Effective communication of occupational health and safety
responsibilities, targets, priorities, key performance indicators, global offers and framework conditions for the entire
Group is supported by Group-wide engagement activities in
line with our motto of “Take care of what matters.”
By creating general health and safety awareness, we support
health and safety among the people working at and for Bayer.
The Board of Management, our managerial staff and our
employees are furthermore regularly informed about occupational health and safety performance, including about safety
indicators and incident KPIs and, if necessary, individual incidents.

Supplier HSE audits
As part of our responsibilities, our HSE audit activities also
extend to our supply chain. HSE and sustainability audits
complement each other, forming an efficient evaluation
approach, oriented to the specific risks (please see also
chapter 4. Procurement). Internal and external auditors evaluate selected new and existing suppliers also with a focus
on health and safety. Such audits are performed at, for example, toll and contract manufacturers, active ingredient
suppliers and warehouses with significant HSE risk potential.
They take account of the nature of materials, manufacturing
processes used and their potential impacts on health and
safety. Local, regional and global audits are in place to build
short and effective pathways to the respective suppliers
based on their respective HSE risk.

Group-wide engagement activities include our global Health
and Safety Day for all employees, underlining the fact that at
Bayer, health and safety are indeed a priority and non-negotiable. This year, the goal was to remind everyone at Bayer
that “Health for all” begins with each of us. Beyond that, as
part of the Dynamic Shared Ownership (DSO) integration, a
conscious choice has been made to let teams and business
organizations own and evaluate the need for further activities based on business requirements and to set the focus
required in their areas to support our overall health and
safety goals at Bayer – under the motto of: “Let’s keep
Bayer safe and healthy.”

The results of these HSE audits are factored into the supplier selection and management processes. In 2024, 339
(2023: 363) suppliers were evaluated by means of HSE
audits or audits covering HSE topics. In case nonconformities related to health and safety are identified during an

A global newsletter provides information about sustainability,
health and safety performance, key initiatives, regulations,
HSE audit and training updates, digital enablers and best
practices. All key occupational health and safety topics are
additionally posted on a central communication platform.

Health and safety training
Within the context of our occupational health and safety
management, Bayer employees and employees of contractors receive appropriate training in the prevention of accidents and safety incidents and in taking care of their own
health.
Due to different health and safety focuses and risks, and
specific local laws and conditions, compliance-relevant mandatory training activities take place at country or site level.
A global training catalogue is in place to support countries
and sites in fulfilling health and safety training requirements.
This training catalogue includes over 1,000 web-based training units on a broad range of HSE-relevant topics in several
languages, supporting the organization in maintaining a healthy
and safe place to work. Driver safety courses such as "Fatigue Management" and "Driving Safely, Driving Smarter"
were among the most popular training units.

8.2 Occupational Safety
Bayer’s occupational safety systems are the central pillar for
consistently driving forward improvements in the protection
of personnel working in all the areas of the world in which
the company operates. The company’s safety program sets
the expectations, and the foundations, for growing an organizational culture that strengthens activities and site operations to maintain compliance with the applicable internal
and external safety regulations at a global, country and local
level.
The Group Regulation on HSE Management and HSE Key
Requirements is the binding and valid regulation that provides the foundation for the global occupational safety program. It covers the effective management of health and
safety objectives, enabling the organization to extend safety
beyond mere legal compliance. Health and safety management systems give leaders, and employees, in-depth tools

to use and grow their expertise to build good safety communication processes, identify and mitigate workplace safety
risks, and share the knowledge of organizational safety issues broadly throughout the company. Bayer also has a
Contractor Safety Program to ensure that companies that
provide services, and specialized skilled workers, maintain
similarly strong safety systems while working at Bayer sites.
Bayer requires safety briefings and special training courses
consistent with the relevant work activities in which employees are engaged to promote a healthy and safe place to work.
The central incident data collection platform for integrated
accident management enables our sites to share accident
analysis information with one another digitally and thus determine corrective measures quickly, making it easier for our
occupational health and safety experts to exchange information about occupational illnesses and injuries experienced
by our employees and contractors. Personnel, whether employees or personnel of contractors, are expected to immediately report work-related hazards, dangerous situations or
injuries/illnesses to their supervisors. When workplace incidents involving injury/illness are reported, a review is performed. Where required for more complex incidents, a root
cause incident analysis is conducted based on these reports
to determine suitable measures for reducing the chances of
future recurrence.
Safety culture
Our commitment to fostering a proactive approach to incident prevention and anticipation goes beyond our primary
metrics such as the Recordable Incident Rate (RIR) and incident severity. To prevent severe incidents, understand the
maturity of our safety programs and enhance overall employee engagement in occupational safety and health, we
have introduced and are tracking a set of leading indicators
at the operational level. While these indicators were initially
presented as a score, our focus has now shifted toward analyzing trends rather than calculating a single score.

One of our key goals is to encourage active employee participation in hazard recognition and reporting. These reports are
analyzed to identify conditions and behaviors that could lead
to more serious workplace injuries or illnesses. In such cases,
sites are encouraged to conduct incident investigations, identify root causes, take corrective actions and share lessons
learned across the organization to prevent similar incidents in
the future.
Hazard identification and assessment
The workplaces of our employees and those of contractors
under the direct supervision of Bayer are regularly subjected
to a comprehensive occupational health and safety (OHS)
risk assessment and hazard analysis by Bayer experts. The
OHS Risk Assessment is a systematic process of hazard
identification, evaluation of the risks (i.e. probability and consequence) that the identified hazards create, risk treatment
to reduce or eliminate risks, and risk monitoring through
documentation and reviews to ensure controls are in place
to maximize personnel safety. Details of this process are
specified in the Group Regulation on HSE Management and
HSE Key Requirements.
Bayer uses a proactive risk assessment approach to prevent
workplace injury and illness that relies on the involvement of
managers, supervisors, health and safety experts and employees to identify relevant work hazards, gauge the risks
and develop solutions to collaboratively improve workplace
safety. This approach also supports regulatory and internal
policy compliance, personnel protection and the company’s
expectation of a culture that emphasizes a healthy and safe
workplace.
Measures derived from risk assessments to protect the health
and safety of our employees use the hierarchy of controls
approach as follows: 1) eliminate the hazard, 2) substitute
with less hazardous processes, operations, materials or
equipment, 3) use engineering controls and reorganization of

work, 4) use administrative controls, including training, and
5) use adequate personal protective equipment.
Permit for hazardous work
A program is in place for work requiring a “permit for hazardous work” and the level of approval. A work permit is issued in all cases of work with potential exposure to hazardous substances, electricity, moving equipment, radiation,
heat and cold, “hot work” (welding, grinding, etc.), work at
height, or work in confined spaces, work on safety-related
equipment, heavy or difficult lifting work. These work permits
define the required safety measures in writing.
Road safety
The Bayer health, safety and environmental protection (HSE)
program approach addresses the safety of employees on
the road when traveling to meet our customers and external
stakeholders. We implement a systematic program approach to reduce high-severity injuries and fatalities on the
roads in the long term.
Our approach is to implement a risk-based approach by
considering specific country risks and enforcement levels,
local Bayer business factors, type of vehicle used and availability of reasonable external training and telematics resources. Local country teams incorporate these factors and
are working to improve program maturity in the four pillars of
1) Safe Vehicles, 2) Safe Driving Skills, 3) Positive Management Culture and 4) Policy and Planning. Bayer successfully
reduced road incidents by fostering strong collaboration
among different divisions and key support functions such as
HSE, fleet management and HR across countries. This
teamwork helped everyone work together to improve road
safety globally. Furthermore, senior regional representatives
discuss road safety topics periodically and share best practices and lessons learned from collisions involving severe injuries with each other.

8.2 Occupational Safety

Behavioral safety
Bayer continues to promote safety-conscious behavior as an
important element in the overall occupational health and
safety program to reduce workplace incidents and illnesses.
Our global behavioral safety program aims to develop and
maintain a strong safety culture through positive reinforcement and accountability, emphasizing the importance of
leader and employee involvement in safety practices. Leaders are required to establish programs to encourage safe
behaviors and correct unsafe actions, while employees are
encouraged to participate in safety observation programs.
Key behavior safety program aspects include improving hazard awareness, training for building and reinforcing safe habits and a method for addressing at-risk (unsafe) behaviors.
Many sites have implemented the program and evaluate it
periodically. As part of the incident management, the sites
also use a globally available incident reporting tool to record
behavior observations and take timely actions as per the hierarchy of controls approach.
Machinery safety
At Bayer, the objective of machinery safety is to ensure the
safety of all machines and packaging units that are specified,
designed, purchased, operated and maintained at Bayer over
their entire lifecycle and to reduce the risks for our employees
and the environment from the operation of this machinery.
This is addressed by our Group Regulation on HSE Management & Key Requirements applicable to our facilities or sites
for new and existing machines that are operated by Bayer,
or for which Bayer is legally liable.
Checklists and a web-based training unit are available to
evaluate machines vis-a-vis their safety and to identify deficiencies. In addition to the training, we offer a regular open
experience exchange between our experts on the subject of
machinery safety, in which the processes are explained in
more detail, as needed.

Biosafety
In accordance with the guidelines of the World Health
Organization (WHO) on biorisk management, we consider
biosafety to comprise the principles, technologies and processes implemented to prevent unintended exposure to
biological materials that could pose a risk to people or the
environment. Misuse or theft of biological materials is also
prevented by corresponding measures.

The same rules on biosafety apply in amended form for the
new cell and gene therapy technology platform as for the
rest of the Bayer Group (please see chapter 2. Corporate
Governance). The platform’s partners have adopted the content of the Group Regulation on HSE Management and HSE
Key Requirements and thus the issue of biosafety and have
undertaken to compile risk assessments. The biosafety experts maintain a steady dialogue with one another.

Biological material must be handled with suitable care to
ensure that employees, the local community and the environment are protected. This material includes organisms
(in some cases genetically modified) such as microorganisms, invertebrates, vertebrates, plants, cell cultures or parts
thereof, and toxins and allergens. An assessment of the
biosafety risk is necessary before biological materials can
be used, particularly in research and development (R&D) and
production. These analyses are conducted by the employee
responsible for biosafety in each case and verified together
with an expert. When needed, we use a digital tool for systematic recording. Employees entrusted with biosafety matters possess the necessary expertise.

The implementation of legal and Bayer Group guidelines on
biosafety is also overseen by the HSE audit program.
Contractors on Bayer sites
Bayer is committed to ensuring the safety of its contractors
at its own facilities. To integrate contractor safety into the
safety management system and to establish a common
approach for managing risks associated with contractors,
we build on the Group Regulation on “Contractor & Guest:
HSE Management of Non-Supervised Contractors and
Guests on Bayer Premises”. This regulation supports the
Group Regulation on Management of Contingent Workforce.
The focus is on four elements:

Processes for carrying out assessments and other necessary measures are established in a Group Regulation on
Biosafety that is based on the specifications of the WHO,
among others. Wherever local laws and regulations are more
stringent than the standards laid out by the Group regulation, the more stringent variant takes precedence.
A group of biosafety experts from the divisions and regions
cooperates within the Bayer Biosafety Panel. This global
panel is responsible for developing, reviewing and implementing Bayer’s biosafety rules throughout the Group. It also
advises and supports the biosafety community, with which it
maintains regular communication to ensure a uniform high
standard of biosafety throughout the company.

transportation and storage safety is monitored through a
risk-based audit system. It is also anchored in our rules for
collaboration with service suppliers.

In 2024, there were a total of 17 transport incidents, all of
which were road transport accidents. Among these incidents:

Our logistics processes ensure that materials are handled,
transported and stored according to the relevant regulations
and the materials' respective hazard potential. This also involves selecting suitable logistics and warehouse suppliers.
The underlying standards include both internal Bayer guidelines, such as the Global Transport Requirements, and the
rules of the international crop protection association CropLife
International and the European Guidelines on Good Distribution Practice of Medicinal Products for Human Use.

// Four involved the transportation of hazardous materials/dangerous goods.
// Nine incidents were related to the transportation of
(treated) seeds.
// Two incidents resulted in severe personal injuries or fatalities.
// Six incidents also resulted in a loss of product.
// In all cases, the discharged substances were either
cleaned up and properly disposed of or burned on site
during the incident.
// In addition, 15 of these transport incidents involved the
participation of authorities.

Transportation safety plays a key role both in the transportation of our products on public routes and in their loading, unloading, classification, labeling and packaging, particularly in
the case of hazardous goods. We use both internal capacities
and external logistics partners for storage and transport services. Our Procurement unit selects logistics partners according to strict safety, environmental and quality criteria, e.g. as
described in the Safety and Quality Assessment System
(SQAS) of the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC).
In addition to the legally required training measures, we assign compulsory training courses to our employees from our
extensive training portfolio as befits their respective field of
activity.
Around 4.61 million consignments were transported in 2024.
Despite our extensive safety precautions and training activities, transport incidents nonetheless occur. These are defined as accidents causing personal injury or significant
damage to property, environmental impact resulting from the
release of substances, or leakage of hazardous goods. Such
accidents are recorded in detail and assessed on the basis
of defined criteria.

8.3 Occupational Health
In today's rapidly evolving work landscape, the significance
of occupational health cannot be overstated. With the average person spending a significant portion of their lives in the
workplace, ensuring a safe and healthy environment is crucial not only for individual employees but also for the overall
productivity and success of Bayer.
Occupational medicine
Occupational medicine and health is a people-centric science that focuses on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of occupational illnesses, as well as on the promotion
of a healthy work environment. By implementing comprehensive health and well-being programs, Bayer sites can
significantly reduce the risk of occupational illnesses, while
at the same time building and sustaining a healthy and productive workforce.
The Group Regulation on Occupational Medicine and Health
sets minimum standards for employee health protection and
promotion. It includes 12 sections that cover, for example,
occupational medicine provisions, emergency medical care
and health promotion and ensures compliance with legal
and regulatory requirements. It helps our sites stay up to
date with health and safety laws, ensuring that appropriate
measures are in place to protect employees from workplace
risks. In addition to meeting local laws, we consider it crucial
to have our own requirements based on the necessary internal risk assessments to further mitigate to the lowest level
possible the specific and unique risks at work and in Bayer’s
work settings.

Crop Science, Manoel Vitorino, Brazil, November
A truck belonging to a transport company transporting Bayer products

In accordance with the definition and reporting criteria of the ICCA/Responsible Care
agreement between the CEFIC and the ECTA, we have reported since 2022 on the
significant transport and environmental incidents in connection with the transport of
hazardous materials or dangerous goods or of chemicals.

Occupational hygiene
The primary goal of industrial hygiene, or occupational hygiene, is to predict, identify and manage chemical, physical
and biological exposure risks.
To ensure the well-being of our employees, we employ appropriate control measures within our facilities. These strategies encompass elimination, substitution, engineering modifications, administrative protocols and the provision of
personal protective equipment. By conducting meticulous
process design and chemical hazard assessments, sometimes supplemented by chemical monitoring, appropriate
controls and protective systems are maintained. Employees
handling hazardous materials are informed before use about
the physical, chemical, biological and toxicological properties
of the materials handled. The latest HSE data is accessible
for all handled materials ensuring that associated HSE hazards are addressed and evaluated and measures are taken
to mitigate risks for employees and the environment.
When Bayer develops a new compound, whether a crop science active ingredient or an active pharmaceutical ingredient,
a team of toxicologists assembles to evaluate data from a variety of animal and human studies (for details on the research
and development [R&D] processes, please see also chapter
3. Product Stewardship). This data is then extrapolated to establish an occupational exposure limit, defining the maximum
safe exposure for a healthy individual working 40 hours a week
without experiencing adverse health effects. Teams across
Bayer utilize these limits to ensure the implementation of appropriate control measures, to ensure that our employees are
not exposed beyond acceptable levels.
The Global Industrial Hygiene Community at Bayer comprises
a panel of industrial hygiene experts. This team is responsible for developing, reviewing and implementing Bayer’s industrial hygiene rules. Additionally, they offer guidance and
expert support to various teams worldwide.

Health promotion
We live and work in complex and unstable times with many
crises and challenges – each of us individually, but also for
our teams and the entire company. The answer to these
challenges is individual and collective resilience, the strength
that helps us successfully overcome crises and setbacks
through learning and forward-looking action. Resilience promotes the health of employees and ensures the ability of
teams and the company to act. That is why resilience is an
integral and central part of our health strategy and health
promotion.
Systematic health promotion is a prerequisite for creating a
health culture and health processes that enable a sustainably matured level of health and well-being in the company.
Bayer's health promotion programs aim to effectively engage
and empower employees, teams and work organizations to
choose healthy behaviors that reduce the risk of developing
chronic diseases and other illnesses and improve their
health conditions. The focus is on supporting the development of the health literacy of all employees – this requires
attractive and targeted health offers that are derived from
regular risk assessments. The global and regional health experts are in regular contact with external institutions (e.g.
health networks and research institutions), provide the
health framework for Bayer (e.g. health strategy, central platform MyHealth) and manage health for the company in close
collaboration with the HR Enabling Function.
Health leadership

It has long been known that social support from peopleleaders has a salutogenic influence on their team members.
Health leadership is a fundamental and key component in
the development and implementation of sustainable health
promotion programs. With the introduction of our new
Dynamic Shared Ownership (DSO) working model, we are
strengthening a social and commitment-oriented VACC
leadership role to foster the resilience of the teams. This
role consists of four components:

// V: Visionaries engage with their teams in defining a
mission.
// A: Architects unleash the passion and energy of their
teams to deliver more value efficiently.
// C: Catalysts empower teams and foster collaboration
across the network.
// C: Coaches help teams learn and evolve continuously.
To support the VACC people-leaders in their role, we made
various global offerings available in the reporting year, e.g.:
// A health and well-being toolbox for people-leaders including, for example, a guideline on challenging leadership situations, web-based training on mental health and leadership and ergonomics training
// A detailed onboarding training for all VACC people-leaders with health-promoting content such as building trust,
being an inclusive team, building psychological safety,
dealing with conflict, and team wellbeing.
Prevention

Work environments should be designed in such a way that
psychosocial risks can be minimized and that employees
can be protected against suffering from mental and physical
health problems. On our central platform MyHealth, we provide evidence-based information and disease prevention
programs in the areas of physical, emotional, mental and
spiritual health. These four areas of health are the content of
the so-called Energy Workshop, which strengthens resilience at the team level. Over the past four years, more than
10,000 employees have taken part in these workshops. In
2024, by the end of September, there were more than 1,300
participants.
Support

We support employees with health conditions so that they
can access work, continue working and thrive at work. In coordination with the HR Enabling Function, we have a process
in place to provide support and assistance for employees

significant for plant safety are stored or processed. This
goes beyond the legal requirements in most countries.

// We offer our employees and their families employee assistance programs (EAPs) worldwide that focus particularly on psychosocial support from psychological or medical experts who can be consulted online or in person. We
were able to offer EAPs to more than 98% of our employees and their families by the end of 2024.
// We provide more than 1,100 different training courses,
lectures and podcasts on maintaining good mental
health, aimed at various target groups.
// We have trained more than 500 health champions, health
officers and health coordinators. These staff members facilitate regular health dialogues across all levels of Bayer’s
organization – global, regional, country and site – in both
directions. In addition, they can act as health guides on
site and, if necessary, direct employees seeking help toward existing internal and external support offers.

The lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic have
been applied to prepare for other emerging and re-emerging
infectious disease outbreaks. A recent example is the Mpox
Clade Ib outbreak. Following the WHO's declaration of Mpox
Clade Ib as a public health emergency, Bayer Occupational
Health (OH) experts convened to determine the immediate
actions needed. An internal article was published to explain
the issue to all employees and to assure them that the risk
for most Bayer employees is low. It also reminded everyone
that the OH team will monitor the situation as needed. In addition, a case management protocol was developed and the
OH team members were trained on how to deal with possible occurrences in the workplace.

Based on our Group Regulation on Process and Plant
Safety, the comprehensive safety concept for a process or
plant comprises the following elements:

Occupational health and safety readiness for emerging
and reemerging infectious diseases
With the end of the Public Health Emergency of International
Concern (PHEIC) for COVID-19 declared by the World
Health Organization (WHO) and the steady decline in reported cases during the reporting year, life went back to the
pre-pandemic status.
With these considerations in mind, careful and gradual lifting
of all restrictions across our sites took place in 2024, taking
account of the local health guidance, enabling a safe transition to normalcy for Bayer’s business operations.
Owing to the continuous evolution of new subvariants of
Omicron that keep the SARS Cov-2 virus in circulation, we
continue to monitor the epidemiological situation and follow
the recommendations of the experts on possible scenarios
with respect to our operational procedures. In the meantime,
we have used the guidance documents and learnings on

8.4 Process and Plant Safety
In our Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report 2024 we
report on process and plant safety in E2 Pollution.
We aim to design and operate our processes and production facilities in such a way that they do not pose any inappropriate risks to our employees, the environment or neighboring communities. This is conditional on having an
effective system in place to ensure plant safety that enables
operational risks to be identified, remedied and reduced
and their effects mitigated. We are continuously working to
further develop the safety culture, the expertise of employees and the globally applicable Group Regulation on Process and Plant Safety, which also covers topics such as machine and laboratory safety.
Our Group regulations specify uniform procedures and
standards for risk assessment and corresponding safety
measures, and we implement the requisite training. In this
way we ensure that a uniform safety level is in place at the
37 Bayer sites at which volumes of hazardous substances

// An operating concept
// A safety concept (to prevent incidents)
// Damage mitigation concepts
Processes and plants at Bayer are run with a robust operating concept. This concept comprises instructions for
safe operation, including start-up and shutdown, maintenance, retrofitting procedures and response to malfunctions. Site emergency response plans define the measures
to be undertaken in cases of emergency. These encompass procedural instructions for internal and external communication and reporting, including notification of responsible authorities and surrounding communities. The sites
regularly conduct emergency exercises to assess the effectiveness of the deployments and introduce improvements if necessary. Joint exercises are conducted in
cases where external personnel are crucial for emergency
preparedness. The frequency of these exercises is determined based on the existing risk.
Responsibilities and verification
To ensure a high safety level at our facilities, we have defined clear responsibilities in our company that are assumed
internally by various organizational units. Responsibility for
the safe operation of production facilities lies with plant
management. Group-wide safety experts are jointly responsible with the plant operators for conducting risk analyses
and drawing up safety concepts. Using systematic analytical
methods, the process risks of our facilities are identified in
interdisciplinary teams supervised by these experts. Based
on this, the team develops robust protective concepts that
take account of health, safety and environmental protection

aspects. Among the topics covered by these are the installation of safety valves, spill basins and collecting basins, and
the development of emergency shutdown concepts. Everyone involved in this process completes a Group-wide plant
safety training program. In addition, the safety experts must
undergo a globally valid internal training and certification
program that qualifies them to carry out risk analyses in the
teams. The certification program ensures globally uniform
quality standards in the development of safety concepts at
our production facilities.
Ultimately, the Public Affairs, Sustainability & Safety (PASS)
Enabling Function performs the necessary governance for
process and plant safety in the Bayer Group. This function
further develops the Group’s safety management system
and establishes the internal safety requirements, verifying
their observance through special process and plant safety
audits.
To maintain the high safety level of our facilities, the related
safety concepts for each facility are examined every five
years. Technical modifications are subject to a stringent
change management process. In accordance with the Group
Regulation on HSE Management and HSE Key Requirements, maintenance and inspection programs are also
established for the safety facilities to ensure the necessary
availability and functionality in case of need. Furthermore,
all facilities and technical apparatus are serviced according
to maintenance and inspection plans. Mitigation concepts
are designed to mitigate the severity of consequences in
case of a loss of containment. Mitigation concepts specific
to a chemical process or unit operation comprise a broad
spectrum of measures, including standard personal protective equipment, safety showers, removal or reduction of the
number of people in the danger area during certain tasks,
containment systems and perimeter monitoring with gas
detection systems.

Plant safety is an integral component of the planning stages
for capital expenditure projects. We carry out risk analyses
during the various phases of a capital expenditure project.
In accordance with our Group Regulation on Safe Design
and Operation of Processes and Plants, we examine the applicability of the following principles of inherently safer
design and the feasibility of a sound safety concept at a
very early stage in the development of new production
processes:
// Removing or minimizing potential hazards (e.g. by avoiding particularly hazardous substances, selecting suitable
process equipment, construction and design, and optimizing process parameters such as pressure, temperature and concentration)
// Avoiding or minimizing potential interruptions (e.g.
through quality assurance measures during the construction, installation and operation of the plant technology,
the use of maintenance-friendly equipment or the definition of detailed and exact operational procedures that
cover both start-up and shutdown processes and
reactions to foreseeable deviations and malfunctions)
// Designing error-tolerant processes and plants so that
possible process deviations do not have any safety-relevant effects such as loss of primary containment (e.g.
through sufficient temperature and pressure stability)
Finally, before a new production facility is brought on stream,
our safety experts verify all defined safety measures and
confirm their proper implementation by carrying out plant
and equipment inspections.

production and auxiliary facilities and is documented in the
training system. TOPPS training documentation is available
in 15 languages.
We are further developing plant safety through our active participation in internal global and regional networks of experts
and as a member of associations such as the European Process Safety Center (EPSC), the Center for Chemical Process
Safety (CCPS), Dechema ProcessNet and the German
Chemical Industry Association (VCI). We also drive progress
in this regard worldwide within the framework of standards.
Since 2019, we have used the globally standardized KPI
Process Safety Incident Rate (PSI-R) as an indicator for
plant safety. This is integrated into the Group-wide reporting
system. Reporting of this indicator is based on the requirements of the International Council of Chemical Associations
(ICCA). Process safety incidents (PSIs) refer to incidents during which amounts of chemical substances or energy that
exceed defined thresholds leak from their primary containment, such as pipelines, pumps, tanks or drums. The PSI-R
indicates the number of process safety incidents per
200,000 hours worked. In 2024, the PSI-R was 0.12 (2023:
0.12). A total of 117 process safety incidents occurred in
2024 (Process Safety Incident Count [PSI-C]).
In addition, we also indicate the Process Safety Incident Severity Rate (PSI-SR). We report this according to the grading
system of the ICCA.

To prevent substance and energy releases, the causes of
PSIs are analyzed and relevant findings are communicated
to potentially affected sites throughout the Bayer Group.
The reporting thresholds are intentionally set at such a low
level that even material and energy leaks that have no impact on employees, the local community or the environment
are systematically recorded and reported. We pursue this
preventive approach so that weaknesses can be identified
and corrected before a more serious incident can occur.

Occupational injuries and occupational illnesses
The basis of our reporting on occupational injuries is the rate
of recordable work-related accidents, which covers all occupational injuries and illnesses leading to medical treatment
that goes beyond basic first aid that are suffered by Bayer
employees and employees of contractors under the direct
supervision of Bayer (named as nonemployees in ESRS definition). As a result, the recordable work-related accidents
cover injuries and occupational illnesses both with and without lost workdays. We changed the calculation factor from
200,000 hours worked to 1,000,000 hours in accordance
with the requirements from ESRS in 2024.
In 2024, it was at 2.20 cases per 1,000,000 hours worked,
which is equivalent to 439 occupational injuries worldwide
(2023: 459). In statistical terms, this means that one recordable incident occurred for more than every 450,000 hours
worked. Recordable injuries with lost workdays constituted
243 of the total of 439 occupational injuries.
No Bayer employees lost their lives in work-related accidents in 2024.

Occupational illnesses are also included in the Rate of recordable work-related accidents and LTRIR, regardless of whether
they are listed in national registers of occupational diseases.
As lists of occupational diseases are not globally standardized – and in many countries do not exist at all – we document all occupational illnesses, provided they have been diagnosed and recognized by a physician.
In 2024, six new cases of occupational illnesses were reported throughout the Bayer Group, two of them with lost
workdays. These were related to animal, insect and plant
contact and repetitive work-related tasks. The number of
cases corresponds to 0.03 occupational illnesses per one
million hours worked.
In accordance with our Group Regulation on HSE Management and HSE Key Requirements, all mandatory incidents
(including Recordable Injuries and Illnesses), significant near
misses, and nonconformities are reported in the global Incident Reporting Tool. In order to prevent their recurrence and
to mitigate consequences, all of these incidents must be investigated to identify root causes. Corrective and/or preventive actions must be implemented.

9.1 Management Approach

9. Social Engagement
The commitment to science, society and the common good
has a long tradition at Bayer. Like our business activities, our
social engagement is guided by our purpose “Science for a
better life” and our mission “Health for all, Hunger for none.”
Together with our network of partner organizations and
many of our employees, we support social projects around
the world in the areas of health, nutrition and the environment and engage with communities to create long-lasting
societal impact, increasingly by supporting social innovation
and social enterprises.

9.1 Management Approach
Our social engagement takes the form of monetary contributions, product donations, our foundation activities and corporate volunteering. Close intra-Group cooperation between
the Public Affairs, Sustainability & Safety (PASS) Enabling
Function and our country organizations, as well as with the
Bayer foundations, ensures a common strategic alignment.
At the same time, this approach takes account of the different challenges and circumstances in each region where
Bayer is active.
The Group Regulation on Corporate Giving establishes clear
criteria for the eligibility of recipients and the selection of
projects. It also sets out our strategy to create long-term impact in line with our purpose, mission and sustainability
goals.
Our contributions are processed through a database that
enables approval by responsible managers, compliance
checks and full documentation – and thus ensures oversight
of the contributions. It also offers a comprehensive and
transparent overview of our social investment worldwide.

Through a global corporate volunteering framework, we
want to increase the social impact around the world with our
employees. Employees worldwide can take at least one
working day off per year for voluntary work in the areas of
nutrition, health and science and environment.
Through our social engagement, we support projects in the
following focus areas:
Health for all, Hunger for none
// Food security, reduction of food loss, increase in food
quality, particularly for vulnerable groups in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs)
// Access to self-care and healthcare programs for
vulnerable groups in LMICs
// Maternal and child health, family planning
// Public health
Science for a better life
// Support for frontier research in life sciences, data science
and environmental sciences
// Development of science talents, supporting education
programs in life sciences, data science and environmental
sciences
// Science and society: collaborations that enhance the impact of science for the benefit of society.
Environment
// Climate change, biodiversity, and water and waste
management
Community engagement
// Social initiatives near communities where Bayer operates
// Sports activities (local recreational, disabled and
competitive sports)

// Cultural programs (e.g. young artists)
// Culture of remembrance
Disaster relief
// Response to climate catastrophes and humanitarian
crises for underserved groups and countries
// Product donations
// Interventions for health crises, e.g. pandemics
Through our engagement we promote the system-changing
power of social innovation, be it through local initiatives or
global partnerships. A central aspect of Bayer’s social engagement is therefore supporting innovative solutions and
capacity-building projects of social enterprises aimed at establishing knowledge, abilities and structures.
Bayer Foundation, the Bayer Fund (United States), Bayer
Foundation India and the Hans and Berthold Finkelstein
Foundation are the nonprofit arms of Bayer. Their objective
is to generate social impact in line with our mission of
“Health for all, Hunger for none” and our mission “Science
for a better life” (for more background on the Foundation’s
exemplary work please see chapter 10.3).

9.2 Our Engagement in 2024
In 2024, Bayer provided €32 million for social impact programs and partnerships worldwide. This includes product
donations to the value of around €9 million (book value) to
various nonprofit organizations in various countries. Most of
the products donated are prescription drugs and over-thecounter (OTC) products from our Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health divisions. Bayer’s monetary social contributions in 2024 were distributed around the different focus areas as follows:

A major focus in the health area is providing access to
health for underserved communities and people at risk.
Public health, maternal and women’s health as well as health
capacity building have been strengthened in 2024 through
some exemplary programs: Bayer and the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) Egypt embarked on a strategic
partnership spanning five years (2021–2025), representing
the collaborative efforts of both organizations to promote
voluntary family planning and reproductive health services.
The partnership is extending its support to the national family planning campaign "Your Right to Plan" aimed at enhancing family planning and reproductive health services for underserved communities in Egypt.
Since the partnership's inception in 2021, the outreach
campaign has been implemented in 24 governorates across
Egypt. This comprehensive endeavor has been further bolstered by the deployment of mobile clinics, which provide a
range of essential services, including direct family planning
support, gynaecological examinations, ultrasound diagnostics, prenatal care, and neonatal/pediatric care. The impact
of the campaign has been substantial, as it has successfully
reached out to more than 436,642 individuals to date. Of
these, over 390,572 people have gained access to critical
family planning information and services.

In the health area, we continue to support patients in
underserved communities who are suffering from hemophilia. Bayer is a long-standing partner to the World Federation of Hemophilia and its Humanitarian Aid Program. The
objective of the program is to make it possible for people
with inherited bleeding disorders to reliably access safe and
consistent treatment and care, regardless of their type of
bleeding disorder, gender or location. More than 10,000 patients have been treated with Bayer products through the
donation program.
Our commitment also helps in the fight against neglected
tropical diseases such as African sleeping sickness, Chagas
disease, infection with the pork tapeworm and river blindness (please see chapter Focus on: Access to Healthcare).
Bayer partners with the World Health Organization (WHO)
and supported the WHO road map 2030 with monetary and
product contributions to the amount of €2.7 million in 2024.
Disaster relief
In 2024, we provided assistance to various countries
exposed to natural disasters or humanitarian crises.
One focus, as in 2023, was on humanitarian support for
Ukraine. Bayer continued to support with product donations
providing the civilian population with medicines and
healthcare products. The needs of women and children are
at the center of Bayer’s disaster response. We therefore cosponsored the purchase of a dedicated Women’s Health
Ambulance car that serves as a mobile clinic for women on
the frontlines. In addition, a significant number of hormonal
contraception devices were delivered as well as various
truckloads of special skin care products for adults and
children. We also donated important industrial material for
the repair of a water filtration facility in Charkiw as well as a
heating power plant in Zaporizhzhia.

Toward the end of the year, Bayer sponsored a building
project in a Ukrainian orphanage with professional kitchen
equipment to improve the nutrition of over 100 children who
are suffering from mental and physical disabilities.
To provide crucial support to those affected by the ongoing
conflict in Israel and Gaza, we initiated an employee
donation campaign. In addition, the company donated
€25,000 to each of the two nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) we are partnering with. The effort underscores the
company’s support of innocent civilians suffering on account
of the conflict. Furthermore, Bayer committed itself to
support the civilian population in Gaza with much needed
medication: one million products, including important
nutritional supplements, have already been delivered or are
on their way to the conflict zone to alleviate suffering.
Another significant product donation of anticoagulants is
allocated to Syria and Lebanon to support cardiovascular
patients.
We also continued to provide assistance to various regions
that were severely affected by floods during the second half
of the year, including in the United States, Spain and
Romania. These floodings have cost lives, affected many
people and severely destroyed people’s living environments.
Bayer supported relief organizations and launched a
fundraising campaign to provide people on the ground with
the most urgently needed aid as quickly as possible,
mobilizing quickly much needed in-kind support, e.g.
providing safe water storage containers.
Employee volunteering and employee giving
Inspired by our purpose of “Science for a better life,” our
mission of “Health for all, Hunger for none” and our commitment to conserve and protect the environment, Bayer employees have long volunteered their own time on behalf of
their communities. For example, our employees founded the
Pro Social Initiatives (PROSI) in 2018, connecting employees
worldwide for social volunteering initiatives. A global Group

Regulation on Corporate Volunteering was introduced in
2023 with Germany as a first-mover country, enabling employees to take one day off per year with pay to perform volunteering services with social organizations. Employees can
use an online platform for volunteering services to search for
organizations and events to actively support. The platform
also enables participants to create volunteering offerings
and share them with other Bayer employees. In total, 27
countries have introduced a volunteering program based on
the global guidelines and utilizing the global platform to date
(approx. 51,000 employees have access to the portal). In
parallel, already existing local volunteering programs (such
as those in the United States) continue to be maintained and
successfully managed locally. In total, 450 volunteering projects were conducted in 2024, leading to over 27,800 hours
of company sponsored volunteering leave for our employees.
Alongside employee giving campaigns that we introduce in
the case of large-scale disasters, Bayer also offers matching
programs in different countries throughout the year. In Germany, for example, the Helping Cents program enables
Bayer employees to donate the decimal places of their
monthly salary. The total amount of the cents collected is
doubled by Bayer and earmarked for charitable organizations and their projects. Since 2022, all Bayer employees in
Germany have also had the opportunity to have a say in the
allocation of money from Helping Cents and to vote for selected projects. In 2024, almost 8,000 employees took part
and donated close to €41,000.
Summary
61% of our contributions (cash and products) went to lowand middle-income countries (LMICs) to strengthen the capacity of underserved communities and combat social inequality. Geographically, the split of our monetary and product contributions is as follows:

9.3 Bayer Foundation
Bayer Foundation is the company’s philanthropic arm. The
organization makes an important contribution to society in
line with our mission and purpose – especially in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs).
Science Program
The Science Program of Bayer Foundation aims to enhance
the impact of science as the basis for societal progress in
line with Bayer’s mission. The foundation’s activities are focused on two areas:
// Advancing breakthrough science by honoring outstanding
scientists as role models, fostering interdisciplinary exchange, and enhancing trust in science by inclusive science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
education
// Increasing equity in science by building scientific capacity
in Africa and fostering gender equality
The foundation’s activities encompass various programs including scientific awards, young talent scholarships, funding for scientific lectures and STEM education grants, along
with global gender equality and scientific capacity-building
programs.

A science council composed of five external scientists advises the foundation and selects the Foundation Science
Award winners. The foundation’s Board of Trustees is responsible for organizational measures, strategic decisions
and financial issues.
The foundation has a worldwide science network of globally
recognized academic institutions, start-ups, biotechs and
larger companies, along with other foundations and nonprofit and governmental organizations. The foundation’s
diverse offering ranges from programs with a focus on
schools near Bayer’s research and development (R&D) sites
to global awards in African countries.
As the foundation strives for global equity in science, capacity building in African countries is a key component of its
work. Within the partnership with the Alexander von Humboldt (AvH) Foundation established in 2021, three postdoctoral researchers and five PhD students from African countries were awarded fellowships in 2024. In the Humboldt
Research Hub Center of Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID) in Nigeria, African AvH alumni, who
now hold scientific leadership positions at African universities and research institutions, successfully initiated longterm research projects and training courses in 2024. These
projects and courses focus on finding scientific solutions
and developing scientific methods to cope with pandemics.
The research projects will be carried out in close collaboration with selected research partners in Germany and across
Africa.
In 2024, the foundation again supported 47 young talents –
life science students, teachers and apprentices – with fellowships for projects they applied for within the annual
Bayer Foundation Fellowship Program. By focusing on equity, the jury achieved a well-balanced selection of fellows
regarding gender and origin from LMICs.

As part of the Science@School program for STEM education,
Bayer Foundation supported 45 school projects in 2024 and
through that opened the door to inclusive and innovative
STEM education for children and teenagers in Germany.
Promoting gender equality in the field of science is a key focus of the foundation. As a result, the foundation supports a
new award program in collaboration with the Congolese
Foundation for Medical Research. This annual award program is intended for 15 women PhD students and women
scientists with children originating from Central Africa, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Gabon, Chad, the Central African Republic, the Republic of Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. In 2024, these awards were
presented for the first time, honoring 11 PhD and four
women scientists/mothers. Additionally, since 2021, Bayer
Foundation has been a founding supporter of the Female
Science Talents program, developed jointly with the Falling
Walls Foundation. This program empowers early-career
women in science to advance their development by offering
a year-long intensive track for 20 talented women. Participants benefit from face-to-face meetings, workshops, career
talks, peer exchanges and support aimed at helping them to
achieve significant career breakthroughs.
Social Innovation Program
The Social Innovation Program at Bayer Foundation empowers impact innovators as enablers of long-lasting change. It
promotes social innovation in the areas of health, food security and environmental protection. It fosters new business
models and catalytic approaches to attract co-funding. The
geographic focus has been extended since 2023 from Africa
to LMICs in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.
Throughout the programs, Bayer Foundation has a strong
gender focus by putting women empowerment at the center
of the agenda. The strategic direction and financial decisions
are determined by the foundation’s independent Executive
Committee and Board of Trustees.

The Social Innovation activities comprise three main programs:
// The Social Impact Start-up Academy
// The Women Empowerment Award
// The Social Innovation Ecosystem Fund
To support initiatives at their development stage, the Social
Impact Start-Up Academy offers an innovative learning program in collaboration with the Ingolstadt School of Management and Purdue University, while seeking to expand its university network to more higher education institutions around
the globe. Supported by innovation methodologies and
toolboxes, students analyze selected social entrepreneurs’
business models and generate concrete ideas to boost their
growth or enhance their product development as an integral
part of their master’s program. Since its launch in 2018, 97
projects have been successfully supported through this program, both in Germany and in the United States. Universities
in Latin America and Asia will soon be part of the Social Impact Start-up Academy (SISTAC) scope.
Through its Women Empowerment Award and the associated
accelerator and coaching program, Bayer Foundation highlights the high-impact innovations of female entrepreneurs
active in Latin America, Africa and Asia. 2024 saw the award
presented for the fourth time. More than 2,000 female entrepreneurs from more than 100 countries applied for the 2024
awards. Some 15 female entrepreneurs were chosen to receive prize money of €25,000 and a place on the associated
accelerator program with mentoring and coaching elements.
Through its largest program – the Social Innovation Ecosystem Fund (SIEF) – Bayer Foundation supports mature social
innovation solutions and ecosystems in LMICs. This fund
targets pioneering technological and entrepreneurial solutions that have the power to create a world with zero hunger
and good health and well-being (focusing on UN Sustainable
Development Goals 2 and 3). In 2024, long-term programs
with partners such as Project Echo, the Asian Venture

Philanthropy Network (AVPN) and The Pula Foundation were
started, and successful programs were continued:
// In Guatemala, Bayer Foundation supports Project Echo: in
the 12-month project, Echo works with local health ministries to support and mentor Community Health Workers
(CHW), enabling them to provide best-practice infectious
disease and cancer care in conjunction with a wider range
of women’s health topics for women in rural and indigenous communities in Guatemala. The project serves as a
timely intervention to advance national women’s health
priorities. 200 CHWs are to be trained, thereby reaching
200,000 patients with improved access to women’s
healthcare by the end of the performance period.
// Climate change has a direct impact on public health, exacerbating existing health inequities and increasing the incidence of heat-related illness, infectious diseases, vector-borne diseases, climate-related disasters and other
health threats such as noncommunicable diseases. To
address these challenges, together with Asia’s largest social investment network, Bayer Foundation started a Climate X Health Pathfinder Initiative in 2024. The 18-month
project focuses on building a community of “pathfinders”
of 10–15 funders to co-invest in the Asian Climate and
Health intersection and on building an investable pipeline
of scalable innovations that tackle emerging climate-related health threats. The initiative further developed into a
Climate and Health Lighthouse Fund at the end of 2024,
mobilizing additional funding to co-fund innovations at the
intersection of climate and health.
// In November, Bayer Foundation, supported by Bayer
Crop Science, signed a grant agreement with The Pula
Foundation to support the 10 million Resilient Farmer Initiative from 2025 through 2030. The initiative has the target of insuring 10 million smallholder farmers against climate risks in seven countries in Africa and Asia by 2030.
The partnership was announced at the World Economic
Forum in Davos in January 2025. More information can
be found here.

// Together with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Bayer
Foundation funds the Digital Farmer II program of our
partner Mercy Corps AgriFin. This leverages the spread of
digital technologies to develop more efficient digital information and financial products and services for smallholder farmers. The program achieved its goal of serving
up to five million registered users in Nigeria, Kenya and
Ethiopia set for 2025 ahead of schedule.
// In addition, a three-year initiative called the Women Economic Empowerment Program has been initiated in rural
Nigeria. In a combined approach, Bayer Foundation is improving women’s health, stabilizing smallholder farmers’
livelihoods and providing strategies for women’s empowerment. In partnership with local enterprises and a Nigerian Foundation, we are exploring an innovative way of
raising the income of Nigerian women by 30% and of establishing 2,500 Healthy Entrepreneurs community health
worker jobs, reaching more than 500,000 families. Implementing partners in this program are Advantage Health
Africa, Healthy Entrepreneurs, AFEX, Coamana and the
Jennifer Etuh Foundation.

total of 170 participants). The Finkelstein Foundation also
supports a project to make Jewish life more visible to future
politicians and journalists (19 participants). A number of projects also focus on the links and continuities between past
and present. For example, the foundation organized an educational trip for Bayer employees and external partners to
the historical sites of Auschwitz with 26 participants.

Hans and Berthold Finkelstein Foundation
The Hans and Berthold Finkelstein Foundation strengthens
the culture of remembrance at Bayer and supports research
and remembrance projects that address the crimes of the
National Socialist era, especially regarding Nazi forced labor
and I.G. Farben. It also develops programs for a company
culture characterized by historical and ethical responsibility,
contemporary leadership and democratic action. For instance, the foundation initiated the Leaders for Democracy
program, run in partnership with the Hertie Foundation and
targeting young leaders (age 25 to 40) in Germany. The
foundation promotes dialogue-oriented projects in Europe,
Israel and the United States that seek to strengthen resilience in the face of hatred and discrimination – both today
and in the future. To encourage discussion, the foundation
has provided training on combating antisemitism, constructive communication and combating hate speech online (to a

Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) is a bacterium that can be found
primarily in soil, as well as on plants and in insect cadavers. The
Bt toxins produced by the bacterium are used for biological pest
control in agriculture and forestry, as well as to control diseasetransmitting mosquitoes.

GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Protocol
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol is an internationally recognized
tool for recording, quantifying and reporting greenhouse gas
emissions. Its standards cover all emissions along the value
chain. Bayer aligns itself to the Corporate Standard for direct
(Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) greenhouse gas emissions and
also to the Corporate Value Chain Accounting and Reporting
Standard (Scope 3), which covers further indirect emissions
along the value chain. Dual reporting was introduced for indirect
(Scope 2) emissions. Indirect emissions have to be reported
using both the location-based and the market-based methods.
The location-based method uses regional or national average
emissions factors, while the market-based method applies
provider- or product-specific emissions factors based on
contractual instruments.

3Rs principle in animal welfare (replace, reduce, refine)
Replace: prior to each project, Bayer checks whether an
approved method is available that does not rely on animal
studies and then applies it. Reduce: in case no alternative
method exists, only as many animals are used as are needed
to achieve scientifically meaningful results based on statutory
requirements. Refine: Bayer ensures that animal studies are
performed in a way that minimizes any suffering to the animals.

C
Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is the world’s most
renowned corruption indicator. It is compiled by the International
Secretariat of the NGO Transparency International and has listed
countries according to their perceived levels of public sector
corruption since 1995. The CPI 2024 comprises 180 countries.
CRISPR-Cas is a new molecular-biological method of
specifically modifying genetic material. It enables individual DNA
building blocks to be inserted, removed or modified. This
process basically works with all organisms. It is used in animal
and plant breeding, and in biotechnology.
E
Ecosystem Fund
The term “Ecosystem Fund” refers to a sum of grants or other
funding opportunities created for organizations that address
key global societal challenges. This includes incentivizing
participation in expanding and shaping an ecosystem through
cross-sector and multi-stakeholder collaboration, in order to
enhance the positive impact of the provided funds, such as the
Bayer Foundation’s Social Innovation Ecosystem Fund.
Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. Ecosystem services upon which crop production depends include, for instance, soil fertility, soil erosion prevention,
nutrient cycling, soil organic matter provision, pest control, water
regulation and pollination.

GxP (Good x Practice) is the umbrella term covering all rules for

Sustainability at Bayer

Our company set off on a journey to focus the efforts of every Bayer employee solely on our bold mission: Health
for all, Hunger for none. Those last six words aren’t new to anyone who has followed Bayer over the past five
years. What’s new is the unrelenting focus we’re dedicating to them. We want every person, project and process
in the company to be centered on that aspirational mission. Through our three divisions – Pharmaceuticals,
Consumer Health and Crop Science – we are uniquely positioned to support access to healthcare, food security
and climate action and to promote a more sustainable agriculture. Thus, we contribute significantly to
achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Bayer is dedicated to scientific research and technological progress – that has always been the secret of our
company’s success, and it is also the key to transitioning to a sustainable economy. And even in
turbulent times, we stay on track: We promised to reach our ambitious sustainability targets and
continue working toward them. In line with our corporate mission of “Health for all, Hunger
for none,” sustainability is central to everything we do and enables us to create inclusive
growth and value for society.

“Let's be clear:
the days of constantly
setting new targets are over.
Now is the time to take
concrete action.”

But no one can do it all alone. The people of Team Bayer are committed to doing
their part. If there’s one thing I’ve witnessed from my colleagues in my first year
with the company, it’s been their deep passion to benefit people and the earth
with their work. Additionally, we believe in and rely on building strong
partnerships along our value chains. That’s why we collaborate with our
partners in initiatives across the globe to achieve our sustainability goals.
Through our expertise and solutions, we want to make an important
contribution – guided by the SDGs and the principles of the UN Global
Compact. And we report on sustainability in alignment with internationally
recognized frame­works and standards.

Bayer aims to achieve climate neutrality at all its own sites
(Scope 1 & 24) by 2030. By 2030, the remaining greenhouse gas
emissions of our own operations will be fully offset by purchasing
certificates from verified climate protection projects, especially
in the areas of forest conservation and agriculture.

We support individual health and well-being. This applies particularly
to our world-leading products in women’s healthcare, including
­contraception. Family planning greatly improves the opportunity for
girls and young women to complete their education and find employment. This, in turn, contributes to more equality and affluence, which
plays a crucial role in improving health, as well as reducing poverty
and hunger. Therefore, access to modern contraceptives is essential for
future economic and social development.

 We aim to fulfill the need of 100 million
women in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs) for modern contraception by 2030.

Access to healthcare

Target 2030: Support 100 million
people in economically or medically
underserved communities with self-care1

Self-care
Over half of the world’s population lacks
access to basic medical care. That’s why
we are adapting our brands, products
and ­solutions to meet the medical, pricing,
pack­aging and distribution needs of people
in underserved communities. We are developing and expanding our self-care education
offerings in order to provide people with the
information and tools that they need to make
well-founded decisions about their own
health and that of their families.

By 2050, the world’s population is expected to grow by two
billion, all of whom need access to high-quality and nutritious
food. In the face of climate variability and evolving pest and
disease pressures, we need a food system that is sustainably
productive for farmers, consumers and the planet. Bayer helps
farmers to cultivate enough food for a growing population,
improving food security while at the same time offering
solutions to keep agricultural products firm and fresh until
they reach the consumer.

Crop protection
Environmental Impact Reduction

Reduce the treated-area-weighted
environmental impact of Bayer’s
global crop protection portfolio by
2030 by

– 30 %

Crop protection, next to fertilizers and breeding advancements, has helped humanity to feed an
ever-growing population while limiting the increase of arable land, which is a vital step in helping minimize land use change. Yet crop protection products do not just increase yield – they
also have an environmental impact when applied to fields. The prerequisite for placing crop
protection products on the market is clear proof of efficacy, while ensuring no effects on
human health and only an acceptable impact on the environment.
Crop protection products are therefore highly regulated by governmental authorities.
Bayer consistently seeks to develop and offer crop protection products that have the
same or better benefits for farmers, while having less impact on the environment.
We adopted a methodology for crop protection environmental impact reduction and
set a target to reduce the environmental impact of our crop protection products.
Specifically, we aim to reduce the treated-area-weighted environmental impact
per hectare of Bayer’s global crop protection portfolio by 30% by 2030 against a
2014–2018 average baseline.

Transforming rice
cropping
We aim to support our smallholder customers
to increase water productivity1 by 25% by 2030
against a 2019–2021 average baseline2 by trans­
forming rice cropping in the relevant geo­graphies
where Bayer operates, starting in India. 3

Based on the data collected between 2019–2023, Bayer
has reduced the treated-area-weighted environmental
impact per hectare of our global crop protection portfolio
by 13% against the 2014–2018 baseline. The reduction
was mainly the result of changes in our crop protection
product portfolio in recent years.
¹ Water productivity is defined as kg of crop yield per volume of water applied (kg/m 3)

	 O ur water target is currently focusing on the DirectAcres Initiative, which aims at supporting farmers
shift successfully from transplanted puddled rice to mechanized direct seeded rice

Rice is one of the most important staple foods for billions of people
around the world. But today, a large majority of the world’s rice crop is
produced using transplanted puddled rice cultivation practices that are
especially water-and labor-intensive and contribute to global greenhouse
gas emissions. Indeed, rice is responsible for up to 43% of global freshwater
use in irrigation and 10 to 12% of global methane emissions.
Moving from traditional transplanted puddled rice cultivation to direct seeded
rice can help farmers reduce water use by up to 40% and can reduce green­
house gas emissions by up to 45% (by reducing methane emissions from the
flooded rice fields).

Pathway to reduction

Climate program

We focus on reducing GHG emissions
associated with our own operations
and on strengthening the resilience
of our business areas.

Our own operations
Climate change mitigation and adaptation are a top priority at Bayer. We
support the Paris Agreement and the objective of limiting global warming to
1.5 °C relative to the pre-industrial level. We have defined a clear climate
strategy and set a target to achieve “net-zero” greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions across our value chain by 2050 reducing emissions by 90% from
a 2019 base year. The residual emissions (10%) will be counterbalanced
by permanent carbon removal credits. We have also committed to
achieve climate neutrality by 2030. This means that we commit to reduce
absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 42% by 2029 from a 2019
base year. The remaining greenhouse gas emissions of our own
operations (Scope 1 & 2) will be fully offset by purchasing certificates
from verified climate protection projects, especially in the areas
of forest conservation, afforestation and agriculture.

Target to become climate-neutral
Validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), we aim
to reduce our own GHG emissions by absolute 42% compared
to the base year 2019 by the end of 2029 (Scope 1 & 2)1. We are
working to achieve this through efficiency measures, process
and portfolio innovation, and by switching to renewable
energies and offsetting our remaining emissions.

Joining global efforts to reduce GHG
We aim to reduce our GHG emissions. But as a
manufacturing company, some emissions cannot be
avoided. Bayer aims to achieve climate neutrality at
all its own sites (Scope 1 & 2 1) by 2030. By 2030, the
remaining greenhouse gas emissions of our own
operations will be fully offset by purchasing
certificates from verified climate protection projects,
especially in the areas of forest conservation and
agriculture.

Value chain
A large part of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions occurs in
our upstream and downstream value chain. To minimize these
emissions, innovation and collaboration is key.

Clear targets for our value chain
In the future we want to achieve a 25% reduction in Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2029 (compared to the base year 2019).
This updated target for reducing Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions was validated by the SBTi at the end of 2024. This reduction
will be based on a different number of relevant Scope 3 categories1
including the upstream and downstream value chain2, thus going
beyond the five categories we were using in the last years. We will
publish more details on this over the course of 2025.

 O ur reduction target refers to an overall base year greenhouse gas intensity that includes the weighted emission intensities of 17 crop-country
combinations (CCCs). In 2024, the CCC Australia-Cotton was removed from the scope due to the unavailability of data. Base years are defined
individually for each CCC, using data from either harvest year 2021 or 2022 depending on the availability of data. Base years were adjusted in
2024 due to additional data requirements based on an updated GHG calculator methodology and lack of data availability from prior years.

 T he CCCs Italy-Corn and Spain-Corn were not selected based on these factors but were additionally included because data were already
available.

We aim to enable our farming customers to reduce their
on-field greenhouse gas emissions per mass unit of crop
produced by 30% by 2030 compared to the overall base year
emission intensity 4. This applies to the highest greenhouse
gas-emitting crop systems in the regions Bayer serves with
its products 5. To achieve our target, we foster the adoption of
regenerative agriculture practices and technologies by our
farming customers. Based on the data collected for harvest
years 2022 or 2023 (depending on the base year for the
respective crop-country combination), our overall customers’
greenhouse gas intensity weighted across all crop-country
combinations in the scope of our commitment was reduced
by 9% against the overall weighted base year greenhouse
gas intensity of 726 kilograms CO2 e per metric ton of crop
produced. The reduction was mainly driven by lower greenhouse gas intensity for India-Rice.
